    <title>Open Design Engine - Feature #112 (New): Add Current and All Revisions Deletion of Images</title>

&lt;p&gt;ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called "Delete In This Revision", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called "Delete In All Revisions", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The Projects page would be cleaned up considerably if the sub-projects listed under each main project could be collapsed. It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I'm not quite sure how Redmine lists the projects on the Projects page currently, but it starts out looking like it's alphabetical and then seems somewhat random towards the bottom of the list. It might be helpful if the user had the ability to order the projects alphabetically or by something like creation date with the additional ability to set ascending or descending order as well.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I was added to a project today by someone else, and it got me thinking. There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Browser size often causes rendering issues with embedded images and videos (which have a fixed size in the current implementation).  See the attached screenshot for an example.  We should look at automatically resizing these elements to fit the frame they are rendered in.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;We need to create a vacuuming system to mitigate air bubbles in the epoxy granite. It needs to be able to fit around the assembled mold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way that I've found to save the filter selection on the &#8220;Activity&#8221; tab for a project. If these are the same filters used for the "Latest News" section of the "My page" page it might explain why no news shows up for me. &lt;img src="http://innovationsts.com/downloads/mach30/Activity_Tab_Filters.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

    <title>Open Design Engine - Feature #45 (New): Add license usage stats to a public page </title>

&lt;p&gt;During a public discussion on the set of licenses currently available on ODE, we received the following comment.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;"This would be great.  Are you going to publish stats on which licenses are the most popular?  That would really help get a better sense of which licenses are working for (or at least appealing to) people."&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Since we are already storing license selections, it should be pretty easy to generate a real time (or nearly real time) report.  I think it should be included on some sort of about page on the site which is publicly available.  Maybe also include other cool stats:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;total number of projects&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;date/time of last created project&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;license stats&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;number of projects broken down by category/tag once we have categories or tags&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;total number of users&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;date/time of last active user&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;over all sales stats of kits/projects once we have a shopping cart system&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea originally submitted as comment on KickStarter Campaign by &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1722694026" class="external"&gt;Jarryd Bekker&lt;/a&gt;.  His comment is quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brilliant idea! We have been looking for something like this for some time now. There is just one thing we really thing should be included: a web store.  If the site also incorporated some sort of selling mechanism for projects to supply (partially or fully manufactured) open hardware, we believe that there will be a much higher number of sustainable projects due to the accessibility of hardware to the community as well as the flow of funding to the projects. It may be as simple as integrating paypal (in which case there wouldn't require too much development) although the users would still need some sort of guidance/tutorial/template to get going.  &lt;br /&gt;We are completely behind this project and have pledged our 25 buck, but if hardware sales and distribution were a more explicitly included, we will GLADLY up our backing!!  &lt;br /&gt;Good luck with the remaining few days!&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Note, Feature &lt;a href="http://opendesignengine.net/issues/13" class="issue status-3 priority-2 closed" title="Create a donation drive module (Resolved)"&gt;#13&lt;/a&gt; will partially serve this need, but having a fully integrated shopping cart would greatly simplify things for project owners and could create a revenue stream for both projects and ODE (as ODE could keep a small percentage of sales like &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" class="external"&gt;KickStarter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pledgie.com/" class="external"&gt;Pledgie&lt;/a&gt; do).&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;"The one &lt;strong&gt;killer&lt;/strong&gt; feature that OSHW needs for project management sites is visual diffs between revisions. It's totally possible, for any file format that lends itself to conversion to graphical formats (e.g., schematic diagrams, physical layout, gerber files). Is this on the menu?" - from Google+ conversation with Windell Oskay&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
