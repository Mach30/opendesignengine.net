    <title>Open Design Engine - Feature #156 (New): Change "Issues" to "Tickets"</title>

&lt;p&gt;It seems incorrect for the "Issues" tab to be called issues, and much more correct to call it "Tickets".  One of the primary reasons for this is that what information is captured under that module are not all issues: features for example are not (always) issues, but nice-to-have's and things of a nature other than an issue.  Another reason is that "Issue" has a negative connotation with it.  Several places will need to be changed to reflect the update in nomenclature, and this should all be able to be accomplished by updating the .yaml files.  Investigation should be done though into how one might change the labels through a plugin as opposed to the .yaml files.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;From a user:  "I just realized (as I was writing this email) that I can create a new wiki page by simply entering /wiki/newpage into the URL and vioala it pops up.  I save and can then link to it.  While that's great, it took me a while to figure that out.  It may be good to add a "add new page" button somewhere, so it's a little more obvious."&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to allow users to log in with the same accounts they have from other sites, such as Google, using OpenID.  This will make it so that if they choose to, their authentication will be done through them, and if they are logged in on that site and navigate to ODE, they are logged in on ODE as well. There's some capabilities for this already for Redmine, so it should not require reinventing the weel.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I have my email notifications set to "For any event on all my projects", but a comment was posted to one of my dev logs (using the news module) and I never got any notification. I checked and it did not go to spam. Is there a separate setting somewhere for this? If not, I would like to add it as a feature request.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oembed.com/" class="external"&gt;oEmbed&lt;/a&gt; is an open API which sites can use to support providing embeddable content.  We may want to add a wiki macro to support embedding any oEmbed content.  Further, there is an extension called &lt;a href="http://noembed.com/" class="external"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; which allows users to embed content from sites which don't export oEmbed content as oEmbed content (ok that was a little obtuse).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - this looks useful, we should check it out for the wiki system.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;One of the most convenient features on GitHub is the ability to download an entire repository snapshot in a zip file with the click of a button. This is very handy for showing the entire project to clients or other interested parties without having to install a git client (or svn client in this case), or download each file individually.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called "Delete In This Revision", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called "Delete In All Revisions", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The Projects page would be cleaned up considerably if the sub-projects listed under each main project could be collapsed. It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I'm not quite sure how Redmine lists the projects on the Projects page currently, but it starts out looking like it's alphabetical and then seems somewhat random towards the bottom of the list. It might be helpful if the user had the ability to order the projects alphabetically or by something like creation date with the additional ability to set ascending or descending order as well.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
