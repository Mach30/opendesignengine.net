&lt;p&gt;Would like to integrate shipping trackers into issues/wikis/etc so team members can easily track parts shipped between sites.  Note, the macro should show the tracking details in the issue/wiki page, but strip out the addresses of the shipper and receiver to protect privacy.  May also look at going beyond a wiki macro and making an issue type of "ship part" which auto closes when the shipment is delivered by shipping company.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Lightweight, standards based requirements management would go a long way to helping OSHW projects create and track requirements.  ODE should have an option which can be linked to wiki pages, issues, files in DMSF, files in software repositories, etc.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;ODE projects are more than just their source code.  They are their wiki pages, their files in DMSF, their forum posts, and all the content which describes the design, manufacture, and operation of a hardware project.  As such, repository level &lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s06.html" class="external"&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; is not sufficient to capture the state of a project.  All project assets should be captured by a project level svn style tag.  This is a precursor to supporting branching, forking, and merging at the project level.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Note, while this is critical, it is also a non-trivial change.  Listing as "under consideration" until development can really get going again and we can assign it a real target version.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

    <title>Open Design Engine - Feature #156 (New): Change "Issues" to "Tickets"</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;It seems incorrect for the "Issues" tab to be called issues, and much more correct to call it "Tickets".  One of the primary reasons for this is that what information is captured under that module are not all issues: features for example are not (always) issues, but nice-to-have's and things of a nature other than an issue.  Another reason is that "Issue" has a negative connotation with it.  Several places will need to be changed to reflect the update in nomenclature, and this should all be able to be accomplished by updating the .yaml files.  Investigation should be done though into how one might change the labels through a plugin as opposed to the .yaml files.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to allow users to log in with the same accounts they have from other sites, such as Google, using OpenID.  This will make it so that if they choose to, their authentication will be done through them, and if they are logged in on that site and navigate to ODE, they are logged in on ODE as well. There's some capabilities for this already for Redmine, so it should not require reinventing the weel.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I have my email notifications set to "For any event on all my projects", but a comment was posted to one of my dev logs (using the news module) and I never got any notification. I checked and it did not go to spam. Is there a separate setting somewhere for this? If not, I would like to add it as a feature request.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The most comprehensive flight tracker I've found, &lt;a class="external" href="http://habhub.org/predict/"&gt;http://habhub.org/predict/&lt;/a&gt;, is unable to run predictions for launches scheduled more than 180h in the future. In my testing of multiple scenarios, flight path and ground track distance is extremely variable from day to day.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;This means that we won't be able to schedule launches more than a week in advance, which may make coordinating a large team difficult.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I'm not quite sure how Redmine lists the projects on the Projects page currently, but it starts out looking like it's alphabetical and then seems somewhat random towards the bottom of the list. It might be helpful if the user had the ability to order the projects alphabetically or by something like creation date with the additional ability to set ascending or descending order as well.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Idea originally submitted as comment on KickStarter Campaign by &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1722694026" class="external"&gt;Jarryd Bekker&lt;/a&gt;.  His comment is quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brilliant idea! We have been looking for something like this for some time now. There is just one thing we really thing should be included: a web store.  If the site also incorporated some sort of selling mechanism for projects to supply (partially or fully manufactured) open hardware, we believe that there will be a much higher number of sustainable projects due to the accessibility of hardware to the community as well as the flow of funding to the projects. It may be as simple as integrating paypal (in which case there wouldn't require too much development) although the users would still need some sort of guidance/tutorial/template to get going.  &lt;br /&gt;We are completely behind this project and have pledged our 25 buck, but if hardware sales and distribution were a more explicitly included, we will GLADLY up our backing!!  &lt;br /&gt;Good luck with the remaining few days!&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Note, Feature &lt;a href="http://opendesignengine.net/issues/13" class="issue status-3 priority-2 closed" title="Create a donation drive module (Resolved)"&gt;#13&lt;/a&gt; will partially serve this need, but having a fully integrated shopping cart would greatly simplify things for project owners and could create a revenue stream for both projects and ODE (as ODE could keep a small percentage of sales like &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" class="external"&gt;KickStarter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pledgie.com/" class="external"&gt;Pledgie&lt;/a&gt; do).&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
