<h2>A new kind of drone, a new kind of private rocket</h2>

<p><span class="author">Added by <a href="../../../users/226.html" class="icon icon-contributor-license">Samer Najia</a> <a href="../../../projects/harp/activity%3Ffrom=2014-10-03.html" title="10/03/2014 11:45 pm">about 8 years</a> ago</span></p>
<div class="wiki">
<p>The goal behind HARP, at least at its inception, was more than just to reach the upper atmosphere and come back down.  It had to come back down where it launched from, or more correctly to a specific set of GPS co-ordinates.  The payload has to come back autonomously, streaming video all the way up and down.  Finally, the recovery system should allow remote control when within range for final landing guidance.  However that requires human intervention and if there is none the payload should proceed to auto-land.</p>


	<p>Ultimately HARP is a new kind of drone.  The sort that can get up to altitude quickly, deliver a payload (for example, low earth orbit injection, or a long range drone) quickly and allow it to return to its destination at its leisure.  For example, if I wanted to surveil a area several miles away because, say, there is a flood and it is not safe to go there, I don't have to get anywhere close to the area and I don't have to wait for my drone to get up to altitude and waste time.  Instead, it could be up at 5000-100000' in seconds or a few short minutes.  The higher it is, the more it can see and the further it can go.</p>


	<p>An alternative is to launch and recover in the traditional sense, but the payload does not self guide, it just broadcasts its location.  I just think that HARP should fly for more than just the notion of flight....but to do something.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>This is a great start!  This really gets into the meat of the project.  From your description i am extracting the following items as Technical System requirements.</p>


	<p>1. Launch an amateur rocket to upper atmosphere (10-20k ft - may be further refined based on launch site parameters and FAA waiver)<br />2. Rocket must be capable of returning to the launch site (or specific GPS coordinates) during the recovery phase<br />3. Rocket must return autonomously to the vicinity of the launch site (or a specified GPS coordinate)<br />4. Rocket must stream video throughout the entire flight profile.  -- Are there any requirements about the quality of the video?<br />5. Rocket must be able to transition from autonomous to human guided flight during the recovery phase. Or if no input is detected, then proceed autonomously.</p>


	<p>The last sentence... the "do something" requirement... is the most vague, and yet, the most critical part of the design process.  Until you know what you want the system to DO, there's no point in going any farther with the design.  If instead you just want to "test the waters" and see what is possible given a typical system, then that is a completely different design process.</p>


	<p>The other set of requirements are Project requirements.  These differ from the Technical requirements because they are about project management as opposed to the technical design of the system. These things would include:<br />1. Anticipated total cost of the project?<br />2. Any particular constraints on the time frame of the project?<br />3. Particular stakeholders to keep in mind?<br />4. Are there marketing/advertizing considerations?</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Comments:</p>


	<p>If we want HARP to go far, how about 10K to 100K ft for Requirement <a href="../../../issues/1.html" class="issue status-5 priority-2 closed" title="Automatically create SVN Repositories when Repository module is turned on (Closed)">#1</a></p>


	<p>Ok, how about this:</p>


	<p>1. Launch an amateur rocket to upper atmosphere (10-110k ft - may be further refined based on launch site parameters and FAA waiver)<br />2. Rocket must be capable of returning to the launch site (or specific GPS coordinates) during the recovery phase<br />3. Rocket must return autonomously to the vicinity of the launch site (or a specified GPS coordinate)<br />4. Rocket must stream video throughout the entire flight profile. -- HD video preferred depending on storage capabilities<br />5. Rocket must be able to transition from autonomous to human guided flight during the recovery phase. Or if no input is detected, then proceed autonomously.<br />6. Rocket must be able to collect altitude (air pressure), speed, acceleration, temperature and position information from before launch and throughout the flight profile<br />7. Rocket must be able to store flight data and potentially transmit telemetry to an ground station for OSD purposes</p>


	<p>In response to the remaining questions, some can be requirements.  For example:</p>


	<p>- Maximum development cost must be no more than $10,000 per final prototype, to include scale models, test systems and all components<br />- System must not be sponsored by a government entity, but may be presented to a government entity post successful flight as a proof of concept<br />- The timeframe for development shall not exceed one calendar year from the beginning of actual design<br />- The system may enlist limited, minority sponsorship from charitable or other non-profit organizations, or corporate entities for the sole purpose of marketing for those entities.  The marketing may include logos on the launch vehicle and/or display of same on the project site and in credits for any generated media.</p>


	<p>Of course this says nothing about reality, but I figured if we are defining requirements, let's get this matrix in and see if we can meet it and flesh it out, soup to nuts.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I think we should define a few requirements related to reach component.  For example, if we want R/C capability, with servos, and autonomous operation, we will have to define the requirements of the subsystems.  So how about we begin like this:</p>


	<p>Electronics package requirements (all components must be able to operate in vacuum and withstand 20Gs and all transmissions must support the full flight profile):<br />- MicroController (Arduino, BeagleBone)<br />- Onboard APM (Ardu Pilot)<br />- R/C receiver, max receive range 5000' (just short of 1 mile) in the open<br />- 2 Servos (left and right elevon)<br />- GPS module<br />- Altimeter/Pressure sensor able to sense full range of flight envelope<br />- Power supply/Battery to supply all components as well as secondary/boost stage ignition power<br />- 3 axis gyro<br />- Accelerometer<br />- Data Logger<br />- Warbler (sound beacon in case retrieval requires some travel)<br />- Onboard strobe (for recovery)<br />- FPV Camera and OSD system (forward facing)<br />- FPV Camera (rearward camera)<br />- Telemetry transmitter (separate from OSD)<br />- Payload bay sled able to fit in a tube of xx diameter and be yy long<br />- Entire payload package should not weight more than gg grams<br />- Emergency eject of the payload package should be possible?  Based on what?  Autonomous emergency decision?</p>


	<p>Ground Station:<br />- OSD Receiver (need to define range)<br />- Telemetry Receiver (need to define range)<br />- R/C Controller (typically more than 400 feet is pointless)<br />- Video display/video receiver (need to define range, but ostensibly the full flight profile)</p>


	<p>Anyone?  Anyone?</p></div>
