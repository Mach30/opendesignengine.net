	<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />To produce a method of measuring and displaying the discharge exhaust temperature of a rocket engine for future versions of the Shepard Test Stand.</p>


<strong>Construction Process</strong>
	<ol>
	<li>Take a webcam and remove the IR blocking filter. </li>
		<li>Add an optical low pass filter to allow the IR to pass, but none of the visible light.</li>
		<li>Optically split the image with a prism</li>
		<li>On the bottom half of the image let it image a regulated heat source where the temp is known, possibly a small light bulb with a thermocouple and regulator.</li>
		<li>Feed the upper half of the image with the filtered optical image of the rocket engine's plume.</li>
	</ol>


	<p><strong>Principle of Operation</strong><br />The brightness of the upper image, relative to the intensity of the lower image will give you a ratio to multiply the known temp of the regulated source by to derive the temp of the plume at a scan rate of 30-60 readings per sec.  Note that as the brightness changes, the camera will electronically iris down, but will do so on both halves of the image, which preserves the ratio.  This data could be displayed as a value in real time with the rest of the readings from the control system.  If the image were automatically cropped to include only the top image and normalized to register the peak temperature as the maximum scale in a post production process, this would provide a 30-60 fps movie of the thermal energy during the engine run.  This image analysis and storage is something a Beaglebone or other ARM processor running Linux can handle.  For something similar, but without the reference or normalization, have a look at <a class="external" href="http://youtu.be/qeuJKUIw220">http://youtu.be/qeuJKUIw220</a>.</p>

<h3 >Q1. Why are we making this?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q1-Why-are-we-making-this" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A1.</strong> The average reading time of .17-.22 sec determined by the physical characteristics of a thermocouple capable of being placed directly in the discharge stream of a high power rocket as well as the sense time of the amplifier is just too slow to yield any kind of real data on a 6-12 second burn;  we'd only get 30 to 35 readings.  This could give us a max temp reading, but the resolution across the time domain is simply not high enough to see a sudden drop or "chugging" as the result of a poor burn, nor would it give us data we could reconcile to a real time event. Clearly another measurement technique is needed to yield data useful in the evaluation and troubleshooting of rocket engines.</p>

<h3 >Q2. Who is this for?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q2-Who-is-this-for" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A2.</strong> Besides the Shepard Test Stand, this device would be of use in furnaces, kilns, casting, and a number of industrial processes.  Other uses include emergency services such as firefighting and industrial maintenance.</p>


	<a name="Q3-How-will-this-be-used"></a>
<h3 >Q3. How will this be used?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q3-How-will-this-be-used" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A3.</strong> The instrument will be used in a standalone configuration to visualize the temperature of objects through the use of optics or may be mounted on or within another device such as the Shepard test stand.  Where the radiant thermal energy would be destructive to the device the temperature may be measured using indirect sighting such as a prism, mirror, or fiber optic cable.  These readings are thermal maps which can be reconciled with real time sensor data.</p>

<h3 >Q4. What features does it need to have (now)?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q4-What-features-does-it-need-to-have-now" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A4.</strong> For now, the instrument needs to be able to detect a range of thermal energy from a 100 to 1000 degrees C and measure it with no more than a 1% absolute error, .01% relative error.  The minimum scan rate should be 15Hz with no more than a 5mS lag.  A thermal map or image would be preferable to point readings.</p>

<h3 >Q5. What features does it need to have (later)?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q5-What-features-does-it-need-to-have-later" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A5.</strong> The design should split once packaging concerns start.  One will be built into a device such as the Shepard test stand and will remotely sense, another version will be stand alone for general scientific use.  The ability to analyse and apply mathematical filters to the data such as auto-ranging and normalizing the data on the instrument would save time in the field.</p>


	<a name="Q6-What-are-the-legacy-requirements"></a>
<h3 >Q6. What are the legacy requirements?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q6-What-are-the-legacy-requirements" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A6.</strong> As a 1.0 design, the design has little if any legacy.  Given that the primary use will likely be the Shepard test stand, it will likely need to be as small as possible and mount solidly to a bulkhead.</p>


	<a name="Q7-Whos-going-to-build-this"></a>
<h3 >Q7. Who's going to build this?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q7-Whos-going-to-build-this" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A7.</strong> Initially a prototype will be built by Mach 30 and it's volunteers for it's own (internal) uses.  This design may be presented and demonstrated to the academic and aerospace communities for their use allowing Mach 30 to gain influence and clout where it can be leveraged most.  Since the design is open, it becomes possible for anyone to build one.</p>

<h3 >Q8. How many do we want to make?<a href="347%3Fr=349.html#Q8-How-many-do-we-want-to-make" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A8.</strong> Two, a built in version for the Shepard test stand and one self-contained unit for other projects where readings are needed, for test stand readings at angles impossible with the built in readings, or for confirmation of the test stand unit's readings.  After this, if there is a market for the assembled units, a volunteer may construct these for sale or Mach 30 may "kitify" them for a revenue stream.</p>

	<p><strong>A9.</strong> Version 1.0 of this instrument will be the result of several level 1 kites.  The first is the detector, the sec
