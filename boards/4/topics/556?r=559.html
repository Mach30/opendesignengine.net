<h2>Arduino vs Beagle Bone Black Discussion</h2>

<div class="message">
<p><span class="author">Added by <a href="../../../users/102.html" class="icon icon-contributor-license">Jeremy Wright</a> <a href="../../../projects/shepard-ts/activity%3Ffrom=2013-07-27.html" title="07/27/2013 02:40 pm">over 9 years</a> ago</span></p>
<div class="wiki">
<p>For awhile, we've been discussing the use of the BeagleBone Black for Shepard 2.0. While Aaron and I had been leaning towards the Bone, J has been pushing back some. J. is attending the NewSpace Conference right now, and it's pushed him even more into the Arduino camp. Aaron has been thinking a lot about the Arduino recently as well, and is now also (mostly) in the Arduino camp. I wanted to capture some of the reasoning here on why this shift has happened.</p>


	<p>1. Almost every educator that J. has met at NewSpace is teaching the Arduino, which makes sense. Staying with the Arduino would allow us to offer those educators a system that's already familiar to them and their students. Aaron also feels that "[t]he educational component of the experience...from engaging students with fire and smoke all the way to problem solving with a microcontroller, is the service Shepard as a product is most ideally suited for." As Aaron and J both point out, using the BeagleBone would carry us away from this introductory market, which is really where the Shepard 2.0 kit needs to be targeted. The commercial testing of Estes motors is a market segment that's well covered, and there is little need to try to commercialize Shepard in that way. Shepard was never intended for this use anyway, since it's always been an educational and training tool.</p>


	<p>2. Related to number 1 is the concept of what J calls a "Grandma Test", and I would call a "Slightly Technology Literate Grandma Test". Shepard 2.0 should be as close to plug-and-play as we can make it so that your grandma, who knows just enough about computers to be dangerous, could use it in her classroom. So far the Shepard DAQ has failed on this front, but largely because we haven't been able to put the care and feeding into the software we would have liked. As we move towards Shepard 2.0 we can take a serious look at making the software more grandpa/grandma friendly.</p>


	<p>There's quite a bit of discussion that has to happen surrounding this discussion, including:</p>


	<p>1. The 30 foot safety radius specified in the NAR safety manual for an E motor. We can't reach 30 feet with an Arduino's USB cable, but we can (barely) reach 15 feet, which is the minimum safety radius for motor sizes A through D. If the 30 foot radius is there only to protect against "landsharking" (the rocket travelling horizontally instead of vertically), we should be able to reduce it to 15 feet.</p>


	<p>2. The reliability of UBS/serial communications between the Arduino and the laptop. So far there have been some ease-of-use issues surrounding the communications, but this should be addressed (at least partially) in future commits to the Shepard software repository.</p>


	<p>3. Stick with Processing for the front end, or move to a new language/platform? We've done quite a bit of work on Shepard's Processing app already, and the Arduino community seems to be very comfortable with Processing, but we need to make sure that it's the best fit for Shepard 2.0.</p>


	<p>J and Aaron, did I miss anything?</p>
