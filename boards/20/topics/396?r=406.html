  <div class="wiki"><p>Good stuff. Here are a few thoughts.</p>


	<p>Technical Requirements<br /><strong>EPSR 1.2.1</strong> - The initial questions had this range as -40C to +80C. Is there a reasons it's -20C on these requirements?</p>


	<p><strong>EPSR 4.1</strong> - Do you have a goal power consumption for this?</p>


	<p><strong>EPSR 4.4.1</strong> - The end * to close the bold out is missing. How was this measurement range selected? It seems slightly counter-intuitive to me. Is this just the range for which the customer has data?</p>


	<p><strong>EPSR 4.4.2</strong> - Sorry if this is a stupid question, but if you're using an ADC to measure temperature, that would assume that you're measuring the temp as a voltage, right? Won't your resolution depend on your amplifier (in the case of a thermocouple) voltage range and how many degrees C per millivolt yo
