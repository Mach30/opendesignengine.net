Like all buses, this one needs a destination in order to know when to call the project done.  I recommend a functional approach where a repeatable result is the goal.  For a ground station, I would think that this goal should be the ability to perform one or more of the following actions for minimum effort and expense:
	<ol>
	<li> Contact a satellite for confirmation.  A pingback where we confirm the contact.</li>
		<li> Contact another ham radio operator through the satellite, using it as a repeater.</li>
		<li> Contact ISS through the station's ham radio receiver.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>1.  Computer System</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Hardware, may be a PC, Laptop, or embedded PC like a Raspberry Pi.</li>
		<li>Prediction and plotting software, I like gpredict, but there are plenty of others.</li>
		<li>Optionally the ability to automatically operate the other two systems.  This can be accomplished with hamlib which interfaces with gpredict.</li>

	<p>2.  Radio System (the receiver and transmitter are usually part of the same radio equipment.  This is a "Dual band" transceiver).</p>


<blockquote>

	<ul>
	<li>Receiver in the VHF ham range (example OSCAR-52 can be monitored at 145.9250-145.8750 MHz).  Reception of signals may be done without a license.</li>
		<li>Transmitter in the UHF ham range (example OSCAR-52 can be contacted at 435.2250-435.2750 MHz).  This requires a radio operator's license.</li>
		<li>A licensed radio operator.  I include this in the radio system because without them, the set may legally only be used to receive.</li>
	</ul>


</blockquote>

	<p>3.  Antenna system</p>


<blockquote>

	<ul>
	<li>A high gain omnidirectional antenna set up for the expected frequency and polarization such as the "eggbeater" and "turnstile" designs.</li>
		<li>Optionally a high gain Yagi array or dish which are directional and must be pointed.</li>
		<li>Optionally a way to point the directional antenna at the satellite using azimuth and elevation data.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For the computer system, a level one kite has little cost unless we want to run gpredict on a raspberry pi (which is both cool and possible).  The trouble is that is is not really all that practical, with the CPU nailing 100% utilization when running with hamlib and serial port emulation to tie it into a radio and azimuth-elevation mount.  It would be better to run the system on an existing laptop or PC.  A possible level one kite could be predicting an ISS pass and watching for the reflection from the solar panels.</p>

<h3 >Radio System<a href="287%3Fr=323.html#Radio-System" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>A level one kite for the radio system of this project may be a challenge. Radios which are capable of doing the job and are able to be controlled by the computer system to automatically compensate for doppler shift cost about $200-300 to start and go WAY up from there. The way I'm going to recommend getting around the problem with the cost of the radio is this:  Just as we assume a person has a computer to talk to Arduino for Shepherd, it should be a safe bet that anyone who attempts this project has both a computer, is a licensed amateur radio operator, and owns a dual band (VHF/UHF) radio.  I recommend therefore that a level one kite for the radio system should be the receipt of a technician class ham radio license.</p>


	<a name="Antenna-System"></a>
<h3 >Antenna System<a href="287%3Fr=323.html#Antenna-System" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>The antenna design for a level one kite has already been done for us, and the designs for the antenna are free to use, available at <a class="external" href="http://on6wg.pagesperso-orange.fr/Page%201.html">http://on6wg.pagesperso-orange.fr/Page%201.html</a>.  I think we can do a better job on the instructions though, an perhaps our focus for the level one kite should be refining the design, a construction guide, and usage instructions.  This is another thing we can "kitify".While omnidirectional antennas like these lack a certain level of appeal the movement of a tracking high gain rig has, as well as some of the gain, we can save that for another kite.</p>


	<p>With the computer running gpredict, connected to the radio and the completed antenna, the licensed user can accomplish the actions outlined in the project scope.</p></div>

	<p>Most ham operators are closet space nuts.  It is possible to get a better price, particularly at a ham fest or from a private seller, if the seller is informed of who we are, what we represent, and what we plan to do with the equipment.  There is also a good chance that a licensed operator will come with the equipment.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Very close.  The antennas require no control input from the computer running hamlib, only the positioning drive does to point the high gain.  Another change I made to the diagram was to clarify that the operator controls both the transmitter and receiver, though this may be a moot point since they tend to be combined into one unit.  Another minor difference is that there are usually different antennas for the UHF and VHF sides, even if you only see the one device, so I made the word antenna plural.</p>


	<p>I will have information on antenna rotators, directional arrays and omnidirectional designs shortly.</p>


	<p>Have a look at <a class="external" href="http://www.ve3sqb.com/hamaerials/oz2oe/">http://www.ve3sqb.com/hamaerials/oz2oe/</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/information/faqs/crow/">http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/information/faqs/crow/</a>.  The larger antenna is VHF.  An easy way to remember is that as frequency goes down, the parts get bigger.</p></div>
