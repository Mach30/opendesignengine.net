Like all buses, this one needs a destination in order to know when to call the project done.  I recommend a functional approach where a repeatable result is the goal.  For a ground station, I would think that this goal should be the ability to perform one or more of the following actions for minimum effort and expense:
	<ol>
	<li> Contact a satellite for confirmation.  A pingback where we confirm the contact.</li>
		<li> Contact another ham radio operator through the satellite, using it as a repeater.</li>
		<li> Contact ISS through the station's ham radio receiver.</li>
	</ol>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I would suggest basing it off of the Shepard Test Stand <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Requirements_Document_v1_0" class="external">Requirements Document</a></p>


	<p>Instead of STSR for "Shepard Test Stand Requirement", it could be GSR for "Ground Station Requirement". That is, unless you want to put choose a name for this project. For example, if you named it "Terra" you would add the T onto the beginning - TGSR.</p>


	<p>One of the things I want to bring up in the Shepard documentation review is how far we want to carry this naming convention. Right now we only use it on the requirements and safety procedures (STSSP), but it probably would make it easier to refer to specific parts of the documentation if we carried the convention all the way the documentation, or at least through the operating manual. It's much easier to refer to "STSSP 1.1" in an after action report than to say "item 1 under the heading "Fire Safety" in the safety procedures document".</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>There's no precedent for the architecture study on ODE yet, and I've only had time to think about it a little bit. It would be good to try to find examples of other engineering architecture studies (a quick Google search didn't yield any), and I think it would be best to check in with J. or Greg to see what their thoughts are as well.</p>


	<p>If neither one of them already have a doc structure in mind for it, I think I can add two cents or so based on the information that you've published in this post. A few items that J. has already shared off channel about what he'd like to see in the architecture study are as follows:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Identify the major elements of a ground station.</li>
		<li>Break those elements down into kite-level phases.</li>
		<li>Identify existing implementations of the major elements and score them (open source has some preference over closed options, but closed options are fine by me if there are <strong>many</strong> suitable and easily substituted ones).</li>
	</ol>


	<p>You have all of these elements in this post I think, everything just needs to be pulled together into a cohesive document. I need to take a good look back through this post over the next few days to see what I think we need to pull from it.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I've had some thought which represents a fairly substantial departure from what we discussed so far.  I mentioned some of it in our discussion in the monthly meeting and it seemed to be well received, but we should of course make this formal.  I am recommending the following with all appropriate changes made to the requirements document:</p>


	<p><strong>Version 1.0</strong> should have the following kites:</p>


	<p><strong>Receiver "Goldstone"</strong> is a level 1 kite.  It involves construction of an eggbeater antenna with phasing network and SDR in base.  SDR is a generic USB TV dongle based on the RTL2832U chipset which allows coverage in a wide band to include VHF Ham bands used by amateur satellites and ISS public channels.  This device is grounded by either screw terminal if mounted on a vehicle or structure, or spike driven into the ground to serve as both grounding and stabilization.  Connection to the computer is standard USB cable which provides both power and data.  Satellite pass prediction and operation of the SDR dongle use a computer running GPredict and GNUradio software.  Since this device is receive only, no licenses are needed in the US for operation. and will allow those interested in hearing space utilization to do so easily with little expense.</p>


	<p><strong>Transmitter "Parks"</strong> is a level one kite.  It involves construction of an eggbeater antenna with phasing network and SDR in base.  SDR is a generic USB TV dongle based on a full digital synthesis hybrid chipset which would allow operation in a wide band to include UHF Ham bands used by amateur satellites and ISS public channels.  This device is grounded by either screw terminal if mounted on a vehicle or structure, or spike driven into the g
