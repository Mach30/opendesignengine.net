Simmons,09/18/2013,"",0,"","",09/18/2013 03:42 pm,09/18/2013 04:24 pm,"ODE projects are more than just their source code.  They are their wiki pages, their files in DMSF, their forum posts, and all the content which describes the design, manufacture, and operation of a hardware project.  As such, repository level ""tagging"":http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s06.html is not sufficient to capture the state of a project.  All project assets should be captured by a project level svn style tag.  This is a precursor to supporting branching, forking, and merging at the project level.

Note, while this is critical, it is also a non-trivial change.  Listing as ""under consideration"" until development can really get going again and we can assign it a real target version."
