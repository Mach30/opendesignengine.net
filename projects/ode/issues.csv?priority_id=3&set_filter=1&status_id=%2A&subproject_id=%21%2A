I'm logging this more just to make sure. Feel free to reject.

This will make it so that if they choose to, their authentication will be done through them, and if they are logged in on that site and navigate to ODE, they are logged in on ODE as well. There's some capabilities for this already for Redmine, so it should not require reinventing the weel."
133,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Low,Preview and Edit Capability for News Comments,"","","",Jeremy Wright,05/28/2013,"",0,"","",05/28/2013 12:53 pm,07/20/2013 01:56 pm,"When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for."
135,In Progress,Open Design Engine,Feature,Low,Ability to Set Aliases for Module Tab Names,Christopher Sigman,"","",Jeremy Wright,06/24/2013,"",0,"",10,06/24/2013 08:55 am,07/20/2013 01:52 pm,"The DMSF module has a non descriptive name that's confusing for people who come to a page looking for information. It would be nice to be able to set aliases for tab names so that ambiguity could be cleared up. I would think this would have to be done on a site-wide administrative level though. Otherwise every project would have their own, possibly incompatible, names for the DMSF plugin."

This is due to the recent updates to rails and friends. We should remove these files from the repository, just to keep things squeaky clean."

It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory."

There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue."
