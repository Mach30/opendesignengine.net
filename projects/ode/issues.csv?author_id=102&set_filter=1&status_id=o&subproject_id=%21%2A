I think it should at least stop you if you haven't selected a documentation license."

Where did this feature end up?"

If these are the same filters used for the ""Latest News"" section of the ""My page"" page it might explain why no news shows up for me. !http://innovationsts.com/downloads/mach30/Activity_Tab_Filters.png!"

105,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Normal,Organize Projects Page Entries,"","","",Jeremy Wright,01/13/2013,"",0,"","",01/13/2013 10:57 pm,07/20/2013 02:23 pm,"I'm not quite sure how Redmine lists the projects on the Projects page currently, but it starts out looking like it's alphabetical and then seems somewhat random towards the bottom of the list. It might be helpful if the user had the ability to order the projects alphabetically or by something like creation date with the additional ability to set ascending or descending order as well."
133,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Low,Preview and Edit Capability for News Comments,"","","",Jeremy Wright,05/28/2013,"",0,"","",05/28/2013 12:53 pm,07/20/2013 01:56 pm,"When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for."
135,In Progress,Open Design Engine,Feature,Low,Ability to Set Aliases for Module Tab Names,Christopher Sigman,"","",Jeremy Wright,06/24/2013,"",0,"",10,06/24/2013 08:55 am,07/20/2013 01:52 pm,"The DMSF module has a non descriptive name that's confusing for people who come to a page looking for information. It would be nice to be able to set aliases for tab names so that ambiguity could be cleared up. I would think this would have to be done on a site-wide administrative level though. Otherwise every project would have their own, possibly incompatible, names for the DMSF plugin."

I checked and it did not go to spam. Is there a separate setting somewhere for this? If not, I would like to add it as a feature request."
112,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Normal,Add Current and All Revisions Deletion of Images,"","","",Jeremy Wright,01/28/2013,"",0,"","",01/28/2013 04:08 pm,01/28/2013 04:08 pm,"ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called ""Delete In This Revision"", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called ""Delete In All Revisions"", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.

It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory."

There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue."
