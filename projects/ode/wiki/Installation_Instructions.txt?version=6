h1. Installation Instructions

Open Design Engine (ODE) is based on "Redmine":http://redmine.org.  The official installation method is to install the "Bitnami Redmine Stack":http://bitnami.org/stack/redmine, apply some custom configuration to the stack, and then upgrade the installed Redmine instance to the ODE source code.  Support for other stacks (or bootstrapped installations) will come with future releases.  With luck, one or more of the stack providers will add ODE to their list of supported stacks.  

Note, these instructions assume you are running the Ubuntu VM image of the Bitnami Redmine Stack and are running all commands under @sudo@.  They were tested with "version 1.1.3":http://bitnami.org/files/stacks/redmine/1.1.3-0/bitnami-redmine-1.1.3-0-ubuntu-10.10.zip in "VMWare Player":http://www.vmware.com/products/player/. 

Useful Paths
* @(bitnami_base) = /opt/bitnami@ in VM images

Steps to install ODE
* Import the Bitnami Redmine Stack into VMWare (the free VMWare Player is supported)
* Configure Redmine to run at http://hostname/ instead of http://hostname/redmine
** Edit @(bitnami_base)/apache2/conf/httpd.conf@ and comment out the line:
<pre>
DocumentRoot "/opt/bitnami/apache2/htdocs"
</pre>
** Edit @(bitnami_base)/apps/redmine/conf/redmine.conf@ to match the following (the key areas are the addition of the virtual host section and changing all references of @/redmine@ to @/@):
<pre>
<VirtualHost *:80>
