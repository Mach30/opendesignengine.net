h1. v0.3 - Sustainability Enhancements

The goal of v0.3 is to grow *ODE* from its current beta state to a vibrant and self-sustaining open source hardware community.  To accomplish this goal, we will focus development efforts on obtaining IT support for features such as integrated git support, updating the visual aspects of the site to enhance the usability of the site, growing the user base through advertising and messaging, and developing multiple income streams to sustainably fund *ODE*.
