h1. Development Setup

The following instructions are meant to help get the ODE application up and running on your local workstation.  Note, these instructions assume you are setting up a development environment on Linux/OS X.

h1. Prerequisites

* SVN
* MySQL
* Ruby 1.8.7 (with Development Tools)
* Bundler (may need to update gem to 1.4+)
<pre>gem install bundler</pre>
* To update gem you may need to run (su to root):
<pre>REALLY_GEM_UPDATE_SYSTEM=1 gem update --system</pre>
* After this update you'll need to reinstall bundler.

h1.  Code checkout

To get started, create a local repository with svn checkout:

<pre>
svn checkout https://opendesignengine.net/svn/ode/trunk
</pre>

h1. Create Development Database

You will need to setup a local development MySQL database and call it 'ode_development'.  Next we need to create a new database.yml so the application knows how to connect to the database.  To accomplish this, simple copy the database.yml.exampe file:

<pre>
cd trunk
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
</pre>

Under the production: section of the the config file, fill in the database name, username, and password.  Be sure to create the database in MySQL afterwards.

h1. Bundler

To install the required third-party gems to run the ODE application, we run the following Bundler command:

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

Note: You may also need to install the libmysqlclient-dev package to get the MySQL gem to install.

h1. Database Preparation

To prepare the database, we first need to run migrations:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
</pre>

We now need some seed data to get started:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:seed
</pre>

h1. Running the Application

Now we should be ready to run the application locally:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production script/server
</pre>

If all goes well, you should be able to open the application at http://localhost:3000
