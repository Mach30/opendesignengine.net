h1. Development Setup

The following instructions are meant to help get the ODE application up and running on your local workstation.  Note, these instructions assume you are setting up a development environment on Linux/OS X.

h1. Prerequisites

* SVN
* MySQL (Currently tested with MySQL v5.1)
* Ruby 1.8.7 (with Development Tools)
* Bundler (may need to update gem to 1.4+)
<pre>gem install bundler</pre>
** To update gem you may need to run (su to root):
<pre>REALLY_GEM_UPDATE_SYSTEM=1 gem update --system</pre>
** After this update you'll need to reinstall bundler.
* Install Ruby on Rails (Currently tested with Rails v2.3.16)
<pre>gem install rails --include-dependencies -v 2.3.16</pre>

h1.  Code checkout

To get started, create a local repository with svn checkout:

<pre>
svn checkout https://opendesignengine.net/svn/ode/trunk
</pre>

h1. Create Development Database

You will need to setup a local development MySQL database and call it 'ode_development'.  Next we need to create a new database.yml so the application knows how to connect to the database.  To accomplish this, simple copy the database.yml.exampe file:

<pre>
cd trunk
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
</pre>

Under the production: section of the the config file, fill in the database name, username, and password.  Be sure to create the database in MySQL afterwards.

To create the database, run the following commands:

<pre>
mysql -u root -p

mysql> create database ode_development character set utf8;
mysql> create user 'ode_development'@'localhost' identified by 'my_password';
mysql> grant all privileges on ode_development.* to 'ode_development'@'localhost';
mysql> exit
</pre>

h1. Bundler

To install the required third-party gems to run the ODE application, we run the following Bundler command:

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

Note: You may also need to install the libmysqlclient-dev package to get the MySQL gem to install.

h1. Database Preparation

To prepare the database, we first need to run migrations:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
</pre>

and for the plugins:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate_plugins
</pre>

We now need some seed data to get started:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:seed
</pre>

h1. Running the Application

Now we should be ready to run the application locally:

<pre>
RAILS_ENV=production script/server
</pre>

If all goes well, you should be able to open the application at http://localhost:3000
