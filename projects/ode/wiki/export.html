	<p>Open Design Engine (ODE) uses <a href="http://capistranorb.com" class="external">Capistrano</a> for code deployment. Capistrano is a developer tool for deploying web applications. It is typically installed on a workstation, and used to deploy code from your source code management (SCM) to one, or more servers.</p>


	<a name="Getting-started"></a>
<h1 >Getting started<a href="export.html#Getting-started" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>In order to deploy code to production servers, you must first have authorization to access the server.  The simplest way to achieve access is to use SSH public/private key pairs so that you don't have to type the password each time. Because SSH is the transport for other services such as SCP (secure copy), SFTP (secure file transfer), and other services (SVN, etc), this can be very convenient and save you a lot of typing.</p>


	<p>If your local username is different from your remote username, add <code>-s user=&lt;remote_user&gt;</code> to the beginning of the Capistrano commands.</p>


	<a name="Quick-Deploy"></a>
<h1 >Quick Deploy<a href="export.html#Quick-Deploy" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>To deploy, simply run:</p>


<pre>
cap production deploy
</pre>

	<p>This command executes the following steps:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Pulls in the latest code from the repository</li>
		<li>Copies any configuration data needed by the application.</li>
		<li>Runs the any new database migrations (including plugins).</li>
		<li>Performs a database backup if the database schema changed since the last deploy.</li>
		<li>Restarts the application server.</li>
	</ul>


	<a name="Rolling-Back"></a>
<h1 >Rolling Back<a href="export.html#Rolling-Back" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>If something goes wrong with the deployment, we can rollback to the previous release:</p>


<pre>
cap production deploy:rollback
</pre>

	<p>The deployment script will keep the last 5 releases as apart of it's deployment process.</p>


	<a name="Database-Backup"></a>
<h1 >Database Backup<a href="export.html#Database-Backup" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>We can perform a database backup at anytime:</p>


<pre>
cap produciton db:dump 
</pre>

	<a name="Archiving"></a>
<h1 >Archiving<a href="export.html#Archiving" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>We can archive by tarring the current release directory with the archive command:</p>


<pre>
cap production archive name=0.1.0
</pre>

	<p>This process with tar the current release directory and copy the tar file to the shared directory.  In addition, it will download the tar file to your local tmp/ directory.</p>

	<p>The original discussions about the development of ODE took place in Mach 30 <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12657120/mach30.org/blogs/jrs/2010-05-21-minutes-from-opendesignenginenet-requirements-meeting.html" class="external">meetings</a> and on the CSTART <a href="http://cstart.org/forum/software-projects/cstartmach-30-joint-venture-for-web-based-engineering-project-management/" class="external">forums</a> and <a href="http://cstart.org/wiki/ODE" class="external">wiki</a>.  This work led to the development of the <a href="export.html#Guiding Values" class="wiki-page">Guiding Values</a>, <a href="export.html#" class="wiki-page">Early Key Decisions</a>, and <a href="export.html#" class="wiki-page">Potential Features</a>.</p>

	<p>The following instructions are meant to help get the ODE application up and running on your local workstation.  Note, these instructions assume you are setting up a development environment on Linux/OS X.</p>


	<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
<h1 >Prerequisites<a href="export.html#Prerequisites" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<ul>
	<li>SVN</li>
		<li>MySQL (Currently tested with MySQL v5.1)</li>
		<li>Ruby 1.8.7 (with Development Tools)</li>
		<li>MySQL header files (i.e. package libmysqlclient-dev on Debian-based systems)</li>
		<li>Bundler (may need to update gem to 1.4+)<br /><pre>gem install bundler</pre>
	<ul>
	<li>To update gem you may need to run (su to root):<br /><pre>REALLY_GEM_UPDATE_SYSTEM=1 gem update --system</pre></li>
		<li>After this update you'll need to reinstall bundler.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Install Rake v.0.8.7<br /><pre>gem install rake -v 0.8.7</pre></li>
		<li>Install Ruby on Rails (Currently tested with Rails v2.3.16)<br /><pre>gem install rails -v 2.3.16</pre></li>
	</ul>


	<a name="Code-checkout"></a>
<h1 > Code checkout<a href="export.html#Code-checkout" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>To get started, create a local repository with svn checkout:</p>


<pre>
svn checkout https://opendesignengine.net/svn/ode/trunk
</pre>

	<a name="Create-Development-Database"></a>
<h1 >Create Development Database<a href="export.html#Create-Development-Database" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>You will need to setup a local development MySQL database and call it 'ode_development'.</p>


	<p>To create the database, run the following commands:</p>


<pre>
mysql -u root -p

mysql&gt; create database ode_development character set utf8;
mysql&gt; create user 'ode_development'@'localhost' identified by 'my_password';
mysql&gt; grant all privileges on ode_development.* to 'ode_development'@'localhost';
mysql&gt; exit
</pre>

	<p>Next we need to create a new database.yml so the application knows how to connect to the database. To accomplish this, simple copy the database.yml.exampe file:</p>


<pre>
cd trunk
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
</pre>

	<p>Under the development: section of the the config file, fill in the database name, username, and password.</p>


	<a name="Bundler"></a>
<h1 >Bundler<a href="export.html#Bundler" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>To install the required third-party gems to run the ODE application, we run the following Bundler command:</p>


<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

	<a name="Database-Preparation"></a>
<h1 >Database Preparation<a href="export.html#Database-Preparation" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>To prepare the database, we first need to run migrations:</p>


<pre>
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate
</pre>

	<p>and for the plugins:</p>


<pre>
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate_plugins
</pre>

	<p>We now need some seed data to get started:</p>


<pre>
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:seed
</pre>

	<a name="Running-the-Application"></a>
<h1 >Running the Application<a href="export.html#Running-the-Application" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>Now we should be ready to run the application locally:</p>


<pre>
RAILS_ENV=development script/server
</pre>

	<p>If all goes well, you should be able to open the application at <a class="external" href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a></p>

	<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
		<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
		<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (It is based upon <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/" class="external">Automattic's Privacy Policy</a> and is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/." class="external">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License</a>)</p>


	<p>Mach 30 (“Mach 30”) operates the website opendesignengine.net. It is Mach 30’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>


	<p><strong>Website Visitors</strong><br />Like most website operators, Mach 30 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mach 30’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mach 30’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Mach 30 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>


	<p>Mach 30 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users of OpenDesignEngine.net. Mach 30 only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>


	<p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br />Certain visitors to Mach 30’s websites choose to interact with Mach 30 in ways that require Mach 30 to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Mach 30 gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a project at OpenDesignEngine.net to provide a username and email address. Mach 30 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>


	<p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong><br />Mach 30 may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Mach 30 may monitor the most popular projects on the OpenDesignEngine.net site. Mach 30 may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Mach 30 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>


	<p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br />Mach 30 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mach 30’s behalf or to provide services available at Mach 30’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mach 30’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Mach 30 will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Mach 30 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Mach 30 believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mach 30, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Mach 30 website and have supplied your email address, Mach 30 may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Mach 30 and our projects. We primarily use our various project blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Mach 30 takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>


	<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br />A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mach 30 uses cookies to help Mach 30 identify and track visitors, their usage of Mach 30 websites, and their website access preferences. Mach 30 visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Mach 30’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Mach 30’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>


	<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong><br />If Mach 30, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Mach 30 goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Mach 30 may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>


	<p><strong>Ads</strong><br />Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Mach 30 and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


	<p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br />Although most changes are likely to be minor, Mach 30 may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Mach 30’s sole discretion. Mach 30 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

<h1 >Early Key Decisions<a href="export.html#Early-Key-Decisions" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>The following are the key decisions to made during the conceptual design of ODE, and the <a href="export.html#values" class="wiki-page">values</a> that had to be balanced to make them.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Should we extend an existing system, or develop something from scratch</strong> - Extending an existing system may mean getting something useful much sooner, but it means accepting many decisions that are already made (language, license, architecture, etc). Values to balance include: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.  <ins>Result: Extend <a href="http://redmine.org" class="external">Redmine</a></ins></li>
		<li><strong>Development Roadmap</strong> - Emphasis should currently be on selecting feature sets for early versions that get the system off the ground and let users start seeing benefits sooner rather than later. Values to balance include: 1, 2, 3, 4.  <ins>Result: Early releases favor existing plugins and function over form</ins></li>
		<li><strong>License</strong> - The license of a project can evoke a strong reaction from the community, so the choice of license should be made to support the shared values of sharing source code of both CSTART and Mach 30. If ODE is based on an existing system, this decision will be made by default. Values to balance include: 7 (and likely one or more uncaptured values). <ins>Result: Per license requirements of Redmine, ODE is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" class="external">GNU General Public License v2</a> (GPL)</ins></li>
		<li><strong>Programming language</strong> - Language choice affects developer availability, barrier to hosting, and more. If ODE is based on an existing system, this decision will be made by default. Values to balance include: 6, 7. <ins>Result: Ruby on Rails, in no small part due to its use in Redmine</ins></li>
		<li><strong>The code repository for hosting the ODE source code</strong> - ... <ins>Result: ODE is hosted on <a class="external" href="../../../account/register.html">http://opendesignengine.net</a> and is stored in SVN due to its high level of built in support in Redmine</ins></li>
