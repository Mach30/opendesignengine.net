	<p>Welcome to the Open Design Engine (ODE) project Wiki.  This wiki contains documentation covering development, installation, and use (on your own server or at <a class="external" href="../../../account/register.html">http://opendesignengine.net</a>) of the Open Design Engine software.  If you are interested in starting a hosted project, click <a href="../../new.html" class="external">here</a>.  ODE started as a proposed joint project between <a href="http://www.mach30.org" class="external">Mach 30</a> and <a href="http://cstart.org" class="external">CSTART</a>.  We hope it will grow to serve a wider audience and be used to host <a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/oshw-definition-v1-0/" class="external">Open Source Hardware</a> (and <a href="http://opensource.org/" class="external">Software</a>) projects of all kinds.</p>

<h1 >Guiding Values<a href="Wiki.html%3Fversion=2.html#Guiding-Values" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>The following values are intended to shape the development of ODE. Ideally decisions will represent a balancing of multiple values. Note, these values were derived by reflecting on the views (or positions) presented during the early discussions about ODE at <a href="http://www.mach30.org" class="external">Mach 30</a> and <a href="http://cstart.org" class="external">CSTART</a>. See the <a href="http://www.mach30.org/pub/about-us/public-records/bylaws/appendix-a-mach-30-consensus-policy" class="external">Mach 30 consensus process</a> for more info on values and positions. Note, these values are listed in no particular order, the numbering is simply for easy reference.</p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>We need something that works better than what we have now</strong> - CSTART has the wiki+forums+polls+version control system?, Mach 30 has its forums+phone bridge</li>
		<li><strong>Getting something sooner would be better than later</strong> - there is a sense that current projects will gain momentum from having the right tool for engineering management, which would be a "very good thing" </li>
		<li><strong>It would be better if we can share the work and the rewards of developing this system</strong> - this includes both between CSTART and Mach 30 and with the larger open design/hardware community</li>
		<li><strong>Release early, release often</strong> - this has been the mantra of other successful open source projects, and is in support of having something "sooner rather than later" </li>
		<li><strong>The defining feature(s) include the ability to manage engineering decisions</strong> - we need to focus on those features that hardware projects need that platforms for open source software development do not provide</li>
		<li><strong>The language used for the software must be one that is familiar to developers in our communities</strong> - you can't write in a language you don't know</li>
		<li><strong>The choice of programming language (and other elements of the software stack) impacts the ability of users to self-host, and all other things being equal, the barrier to self-hosting should be as low as possible</strong> - this value strongly supports choosing tools that are widely available if at all possible (such as the LAMP stack)</li>
		<li><strong>Proposed but not discussed - Site security and information assurance should be a high priority</strong> - organizations in the US will need their hosted versions of the tool to be secure enough to meet ITAR and other export control restrictions</li>
