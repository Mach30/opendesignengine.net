    <title>Feature #133 (New): Preview and Edit Capability for News Comments</title>

&lt;p&gt;When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I have my email notifications set to "For any event on all my projects", but a comment was posted to one of my dev logs (using the news module) and I never got any notification. I checked and it did not go to spam. Is there a separate setting somewhere for this? If not, I would like to add it as a feature request.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

    <title>Feature #128 (New): Add oEmbed wiki macro</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oembed.com/" class="external"&gt;oEmbed&lt;/a&gt; is an open API which sites can use to support providing embeddable content.  We may want to add a wiki macro to support embedding any oEmbed content.  Further, there is an extension called &lt;a href="http://noembed.com/" class="external"&gt;Noembed&lt;/a&gt; which allows users to embed content from sites which don't export oEmbed content as oEmbed content (ok that was a little obtuse).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - this looks useful, we should check it out for the wiki system.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Some of the widgets that the fundraising plugin supports try to use dynamic calls to determine if they should use http vs https for the protocol when including content from third party sites on &lt;strong&gt;ODE&lt;/strong&gt;.  Other widgets use the string "https".  We need to use a consistent (and working) implementation for including content from third party sites.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;One of the most convenient features on GitHub is the ability to download an entire repository snapshot in a zip file with the click of a button. This is very handy for showing the entire project to clients or other interested parties without having to install a git client (or svn client in this case), or download each file individually.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called "Delete In This Revision", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called "Delete In All Revisions", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The Projects page would be cleaned up considerably if the sub-projects listed under each main project could be collapsed. It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I'm not quite sure how Redmine lists the projects on the Projects page currently, but it starts out looking like it's alphabetical and then seems somewhat random towards the bottom of the list. It might be helpful if the user had the ability to order the projects alphabetically or by something like creation date with the additional ability to set ascending or descending order as well.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I was added to a project today by someone else, and it got me thinking. There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;During the release over v0.2.0, we noticed that the deploy script has a few bugs in it such as&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;not removing old releases&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;sub-optimal handling of config files&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;error with migration logging&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;We should address these issues and just in general tighten up the deployment script.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
