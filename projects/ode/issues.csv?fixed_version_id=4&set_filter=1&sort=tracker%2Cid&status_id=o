And I just noticed something that I think is part of what makes the site just a little bit clunky.  Different tabs in projects either have or do not have the right hand side navigation bar.  Go check out the Overview tab, the Activity tab, the News tab, and the Wiki tab for examples.  You will go back and forth between having a right hand side navigation bar and not having one.  This inconsistency creates a jerkiness.  If every tab had a navigation bar, it would cut down on dramatic changes in rendering (smoothing out the user experience) and create a consistent location for users to look for navigation and additional controls."

It is time to update the look to a more modern feel and layout.  Here are some examples to look at or base research on:

* ""Thingiverse"":http://www.thingiverse.com/ - A kind of ODE for projects or parts developed by single users
* ""Little Stream Software"":https://projects.littlestreamsoftware.com/ - A custom install of Redmine with an updated and clean theme
* ""Experimental Theme"":http://www.redmine.org/boards/1/topics/4402 - Source code is available, but is not under active development and requires modifications to the Redmine core.  Might be an interesting place to start.

See attached file for some more ideas about the layout and flow that should be included in the new theme. "

His comment is quoted below.

??Brilliant idea! We have been looking for something like this for some time now. There is just one thing we really thing should be included: a web store.  If the site also incorporated some sort of selling mechanism for projects to supply (partially or fully manufactured) open hardware, we believe that there will be a much higher number of sustainable projects due to the accessibility of hardware to the community as well as the flow of funding to the projects. It may be as simple as integrating paypal (in which case there wouldn't require too much development) although the users would still need some sort of guidance/tutorial/template to get going.  
We are completely behind this project and have pledged our 25 buck, but if hardware sales and distribution were a more explicitly included, we will GLADLY up our backing!!  
Good luck with the remaining few days!??

Note, Feature #13 will partially serve this need, but having a fully integrated shopping cart would greatly simplify things for project owners and could create a revenue stream for both projects and ODE (as ODE could keep a small percentage of sales like ""KickStarter"":http://www.kickstarter.com/ and ""Pledgie"":http://pledgie.com/ do)."

See the attached screenshot for an example.  We should look at automatically resizing these elements to fit the frame they are rendered in.
