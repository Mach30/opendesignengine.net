&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have the companies plugin (with additional features for users to register their own companies directly) so orgs like Mach 30 could group their projects together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should definitely add Indiegogo.  There are probably others that I can't think of right now, so the first step should be to find a good list of popular fundraising and payment sites for individuals and small groups, then make the new master list of supported sites.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;If you select the hardware license, but not other licenses, the project is still created. I think it should at least stop you if you haven't selected a documentation license.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

		&lt;li&gt;Test that the projects are well and truly private&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Preferably have all of this automated in terms of selling the feature (user clicks buy, server turns collects money, server turns on feature, feature gets turned off if money stops coming in, user can cancel, etc)&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Bug #195 (New): Inconsistent visual layout between project tabs</title>

&lt;p&gt;So, I have been thinking about the UI for &lt;strong&gt;ODE&lt;/strong&gt;, especially the theme.  And I just noticed something that I think is part of what makes the site just a little bit clunky.  Different tabs in projects either have or do not have the right hand side navigation bar.  Go check out the Overview tab, the Activity tab, the News tab, and the Wiki tab for examples.  You will go back and forth between having a right hand side navigation bar and not having one.  This inconsistency creates a jerkiness.  If every tab had a navigation bar, it would cut down on dramatic changes in rendering (smoothing out the user experience) and create a consistent location for users to look for navigation and additional controls.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to allow users to log in with the same accounts they have from other sites, such as Google, using OpenID.  This will make it so that if they choose to, their authentication will be done through them, and if they are logged in on that site and navigate to ODE, they are logged in on ODE as well. There's some capabilities for this already for Redmine, so it should not require reinventing the weel.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The DMSF module has a non descriptive name that's confusing for people who come to a page looking for information. It would be nice to be able to set aliases for tab names so that ambiguity could be cleared up. I would think this would have to be done on a site-wide administrative level though. Otherwise every project would have their own, possibly incompatible, names for the DMSF plugin.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;While going through a standard ODE development setup, this is printed out at the end of a successful `bundle`:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This is due to the recent updates to rails and friends. We should remove these files from the repository, just to keep things squeaky clean.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The Projects page would be cleaned up considerably if the sub-projects listed under each main project could be collapsed. It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I was added to a project today by someone else, and it got me thinking. There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
