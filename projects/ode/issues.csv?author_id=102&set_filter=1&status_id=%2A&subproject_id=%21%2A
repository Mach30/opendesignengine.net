There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for."

The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called ""Delete In This Revision"", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called ""Delete In All Revisions"", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.

There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue."
