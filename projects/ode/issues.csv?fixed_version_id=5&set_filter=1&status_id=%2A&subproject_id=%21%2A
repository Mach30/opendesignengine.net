Possible features it would support include:

* LaTeX style equations
* UML diagrams
* Embedded graphs
* Videos(?) - see comments

Need to look at how the underlying programs relate to the ODE distro and what will need to be placed in SVN to distribute this feature."

ODE should support templates for these common types of wiki pages.  The templates should be sharable (link on page create by template, plus searchable on site), and be markable as ""featured"" so the best practices can spread through the community."
