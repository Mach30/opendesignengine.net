One of the primary reasons for this is that what information is captured under that module are not all issues: features for example are not (always) issues, but nice-to-have's and things of a nature other than an issue.  Another reason is that ""Issue"" has a negative connotation with it.  Several places will need to be changed to reflect the update in nomenclature, and this should all be able to be accomplished by updating the .yaml files.  Investigation should be done though into how one might change the labels through a plugin as opposed to the .yaml files."

This will make it so that if they choose to, their authentication will be done through them, and if they are logged in on that site and navigate to ODE, they are logged in on ODE as well. There's some capabilities for this already for Redmine, so it should not require reinventing the weel."
