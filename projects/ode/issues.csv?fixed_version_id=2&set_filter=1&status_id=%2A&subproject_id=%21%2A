We just need to update our source code to the latest version of DMSF to correct the issue.  Fix tested by implementing manual patch listed at the bottom of the DMSF ticket on the live server.

Error confirmed in Chrome and IE 9.  Error message is ""This page has insecure content"".  

It looks like there is a new option with embedding YouTube videos for HTTPS sites.  See ""Enabling HTTPS mode"" on this ""page"":http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=171780.  We should update the Youtube/Vimeo plugin to work with this feature (and check Vimeo videos for similar problem)."

""You must accept the terms of service to continue""

I would expect this message if I was someone registering their own account through the sign up page, but not as the Admin user creating an account for someone else.  In this case, I think the system should create the user and make them agree to the ToS at their first login.  Oh, and the administrative page for creating users does not appear to have a way of accepting the ToS so we currently cannot create new users."

It should be versioned when needed and work similar to file management.  Meta-data is a plus.

First implementation concept is using webdav module for easier sharing of engineering documents.  Look at this ""plugin"":http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/PluginWebDav.  Need to research what can be done to add version control support to this feature.  Also look at integrating svn access through this connection.

Should also evaluate moving live ODE site from http to https before implementing this feature."
