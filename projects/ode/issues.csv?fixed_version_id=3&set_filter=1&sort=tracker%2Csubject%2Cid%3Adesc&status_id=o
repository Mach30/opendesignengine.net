""This would be great.  Are you going to publish stats on which licenses are the most popular?  That would really help get a better sense of which licenses are working for (or at least appealing to) people.""

Since we are already storing license selections, it should be pretty easy to generate a real time (or nearly real time) report.  I think it should be included on some sort of about page on the site which is publicly available.  Maybe also include other cool stats:

* total number of projects
* date/time of last created project
* license stats
* number of projects broken down by category/tag once we have categories or tags
* total number of users
* date/time of last active user
