* Turning private projects into a “sellable feature” (aka restrict number of users in private projects, tiers of private projects, etc)
* Test that the projects are well and truly private
* Preferably have all of this automated in terms of selling the feature (user clicks buy, server turns collects money, server turns on feature, feature gets turned off if money stops coming in, user can cancel, etc)"
156,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Normal,"Change ""Issues"" to ""Tickets""","","","",Christopher Sigman,08/03/2013,"",0,"",10,08/03/2013 01:48 pm,08/08/2013 03:33 pm,"It seems incorrect for the ""Issues"" tab to be called issues, and much more correct to call it ""Tickets"".  One of the primary reasons for this is that what information is captured under that module are not all issues: features for example are not (always) issues, but nice-to-have's and things of a nature other than an issue.  Another reason is that ""Issue"" has a negative connotation with it.  Several places will need to be changed to reflect the update in nomenclature, and this should all be able to be accomplished by updating the .yaml files.  Investigation should be done though into how one might change the labels through a plugin as opposed to the .yaml files."

This will make it so that if they choose to, their authentication will be done through them, and if they are logged in on that site and navigate to ODE, they are logged in on ODE as well. There's some capabilities for this already for Redmine, so it should not require reinventing the weel."

As such, the files module should be deactivated.  This can currently be done on a per-project basis, but should be done on a site-wide basis."
