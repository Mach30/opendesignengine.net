266,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Normal,Upgrade fundraising plugin to include more sites,Christopher Sigman,"","",J. Simmons,09/11/2014,"",0,"","",09/11/2014 06:51 pm,09/11/2014 06:52 pm,"We should definitely add Indiegogo.  There are probably others that I can't think of right now, so the first step should be to find a good list of popular fundraising and payment sites for individuals and small groups, then make the new master list of supported sites."
217,New,Open Design Engine,Milestone,Normal,Migrate ODE source code to match current version of Redmine,Christopher Sigman,"",v0.2.1 - Public Beta Enhancements,J.

I think it should at least stop you if you haven't selected a documentation license."
135,In Progress,Open Design Engine,Feature,Low,Ability to Set Aliases for Module Tab Names,Christopher Sigman,"","",Jeremy Wright,06/24/2013,"",0,"",10,06/24/2013 08:55 am,07/20/2013 01:52 pm,"The DMSF module has a non descriptive name that's confusing for people who come to a page looking for information. It would be nice to be able to set aliases for tab names so that ambiguity could be cleared up. I would think this would have to be done on a site-wide administrative level though. Otherwise every project would have their own, possibly incompatible, names for the DMSF plugin."

As such, the files module should be deactivated.  This can currently be done on a per-project basis, but should be done on a site-wide basis."
