Possible features it would support include:

* LaTeX style equations
* UML diagrams

It should be versioned when needed and work similar to file management.  Meta-data is a plus.

First implementation concept is using webdav module for easier sharing of engineering documents.  Look at this ""plugin"":http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/PluginWebDav.  Need to research what can be done to add version control support to this feature.  Also look at integrating svn access through this connection.

Should also evaluate moving live ODE site from http to https before implementing this feature."
