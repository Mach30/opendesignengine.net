h3. Project Requirements

Project requirements are the remaining requirements which are not tied to specific performance values.

* *GSR 2.1* The ground station must be well documented so as to meet the needs of open source spaceflight designers who will design and build future ground station equipment (at Mach 30 and elsewhere).

* *GSR 8.1* The design of the ground station must enable the completion of at least one operational unit.

* *GSR 9.1* The cost of the first operational ground station must not exceed $200 excluding "consumables", tools, computer system, and radio transceiver.  See GSR 3.1  It should be noted that this amounts to only the antenna system in this entry level system.

* *GSR 11.3* Attention shall be paid into the durability of the design to keep waste to an absolute minimum.  See GSR 4.3.2.
* *GSR 11.4* Wherever possible, the ground station's design should make it as easy as possible to replace components which are consumable or relatively easy to damage.

h3. Future V2.0 Requirements

These are for reference only so that future features can be accommodated in the current design where practical.

*Version 2.0:*
* *GSR 5.1* Direct computer control of receive and transmit frequencies to automatically compensate for doppler shift.  Requires a supported radio as listed "here.":https://opendesignengine.net/attachments/209/Supported_Radios.xls
* *GSR 5.2* A higher gain directional antenna system (such as X-yagis), an antenna rotator assembly which connects to the computer to automatically control azimuth and elevation.

*Beyond Version 2.0:*
* *GSR 5.5* Version 3.0 will use a Software Defined Radio (SDR) as a receiver for higher sensitivity, direct recording, data demodulation (digital modes), and visualization of the downlink feed.
* *GSR 5.6* Version 4.0 will feature the addition of a dish to the tracking assembly as well as an L-band SDR transciever to hit the command and control frequencies.  This will doubtless require more software to send commands and receive telemetry.
* *GSR 5.7* Version 5.0 will feature real time conversion of data and audio streams into a VPN'd link to a common database and network would allow multiple ground stations to act as one.  This would require time stamping the packets and synchronizing using high precision GPS receivers on each ground station.
