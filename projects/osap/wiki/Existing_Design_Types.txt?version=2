h1. Existing Design Types

h3. Danforth/Fortress type

Doesn't reset when broken out, aluminum version depends on extrusions which are too capital intensive for our purpose. Jonjo thinks the fact that the shank tapers on all four sides is really neat.

h3. Bulwagga 

Great design but too many component pieces made from too many different materials. Suffers from lazy fluke syndrome.

h3. Buoyant Self-Righting/Hydrobubble 

Who knows, could be a great concept. 

h3. Mantus 

No one here could be bothered to experiment with their Mantus and report back so I guess we're skipping it.

h3. Spade type 

Great design that suffers from its own sophistication. Capital intensive due to formed parts. Simplifying construction seems to adversely affect performance.

h3. Engine Block 

We need to keep using these to burn up all the oil. Once we have accomplished that we can repurpose these as moorings.

h3. Lead Ball With Things Sticking Out
 
Decidedly low-tech, no shank to bend, also functions as wrecking ball when stored on bow roller.

h3. Convex Vs. Concave Fluke 

I think we will need to look more closely at this once we've started designing.
