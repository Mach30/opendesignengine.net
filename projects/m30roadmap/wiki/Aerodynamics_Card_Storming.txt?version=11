h1. Aerodynamics Card Storming

h2. Unsorted list of ideas

* Wind Tunnel Projects (a'la the Shepard Test Stand)
** The CCL mentions wind tunnels. 
** 9B005 is for the controls/instruments "_9B005 On-line (real time) control systems, instrumentation (including sensors) or automated data acquisition and processing equipment, specially designed for use with any of the following wind tunnels or devices (see List of Items Controlled)_"
** 9B105 is for the wind tunnel itself "_9B105 Wind tunnels for speeds of Mach 0.9 or more, usable for "missiles" and their subsystems_"
** http://cr.yp.to/export/ear2001/ccl9.pdf
* survey all of the rocket aerodynamics software and rank by utility, ease-of-use, and openness
** since it's just a survey of what's already available any export control issues will already be known
* port J's masters thesis on fin flutter analysis/optimization to open source tools
** since it's already public domain I don't forsee a problem
* parametric #CodeCAD models of fins (suitable for 3D printing, milling, and drafting)
** the USML Category IV (rockets & launch vehicles) says that any rocket parts are controlled
** "_(h) All specifically designed or modified components, parts, accessories, attachments, and associated equipment for the articles in this category. (i) Technical data..._"
** http://fas.org/spp/starwars/offdocs/itar/p121.htm#C-IV
** but if we just copy things that are already in the public domain, like out of a textbook, it should be fine
** also, since hobby/high-power rockets are exempt, the parts for those should be fine
* Practice/document manufacturing processes for aero structures, hotwire for foam, cutting balsa for fins, 3D printing, etc
** ** the USML Category IV (rockets & launch vehicles) says that any manufacturing information is also controlled
** "_(i) ...Technical data directly related to the manufacture or production of any defense articles enumerated elsewhere in this category that are designated as Significant Military Equipment (SME) shall itself be designated SME._"
** http://fas.org/spp/starwars/offdocs/itar/p121.htm#C-IV
** since hobby/high-power rockets are exempt, the manufacturing information for those should be fine
* Build a computing cluster
* Make the computing cluster opt-in (from donated hardware/time)
* Study/research impact of surface finish on aerodynamic surfaces
* Research/study aerodynamic “fixes” (like trip lines, vortex generators, etc)
* Visualization tools/processes for aerodynamic phenomenon/flows (smoke, pressure sensitive paint, streamers, Schlieren)
* Scaled composites style wind tunnel by “car/truck”
* How fast of a wind tunnel is reasonable to build?
* Design processes for wind tunnels by target regime
* How to’s for wind tunnel analysis (things like dealing with Reynold’s number etc to properly scale test articles)
* Using other “tricks/hacks” to do wind tunnel style tests (UAVs, mounting to model rockets, etc) <- expands the car idea above
* Software tools for aero stability (not controls or guidance)
* Laboratory measurement software and equipment, especially distributed viewers of a test to remote locations
* Research/study impact and limits on externally mounted features (like antennas, etc) on aerodynamic performance (flow perturbation analysis)
** see NACA Aerodynamic DB (subsonic), see NASA for supersonic
** can document how to use sources like that including doing a flight test with a model rocket
* Hydro tunnel projects
* Cheat sheet/booklet/software for aerodynamic calculations (Cd/Cl build up to go from design to rough estimate of total Cd/Cl)
* Add ability to include environmental impact (rain, fog, etc) to wind tunnel to test performance under all weather conditions
* Aerodynamic analysis/design of a stable recovery system for payload module in case of vehicle failure (no thrusters or parachutes, like a seed pod)
* Investigate using OpenVSP for model/high power rocket design/layout
* Extend analysis of aero stability and aero characteristics software and calcs to include subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes
* Investigation of aerodynamic mechanisms (glider wings, canard fins, etc)
* Simulate/study aero-structural analysis (include aeroelasticity, etc)
