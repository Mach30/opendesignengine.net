h1. Propulsion Card Storming

Covers fuel & oxidizer storage, injector, combustion chamber, nozzle, and anything necessary to keep those items “stable”

h2. Unsorted list of ideas

* Indoor test stand for testing a compressed air "cold gas thruster":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster
** test stands don't seem to be mentioned anywhere specifically
** probably fine just cuz it's so low power anyway
* 3D printed cold gas thruster for use on an indoor test stand
** hard to picture how this is anything other than a pneumatic valve
** maybe pneumatic valves are controlled if they have a certain capacity
* staging hobby and high-powered rocket motors
** the federal stuff doesn't cover this size rockets
** I haven't seen the relevant regs yet
* develop a series of larger test stands scaled around the classes of model and high powered rocketry certifications
** see first test stand comment above
* recreate Greg's undergrad sugar hybrid motor
** probably fine since it's probably equivalent to a class project
* upgrade Mach 30 test stand DAQ to include high speed video
** I doubt anyone cares about high speed video
* develop Arduino (or similar) model rocket launch controller board (including physical safety lock)
** model rockets are okay
* upgrade Mach 30 test stand DAQ to work over ethernet to extend operational range between operators and test stand
** fine. actually probably encouraged for safety reasons
* series of courses/kits to take users through high powered rocketry certs ("required to purchase high powered motors":http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Motors/Cesaroni_Propellant_Kits/Cesaroni_Certification_Special/38mm_Certification_Propellants/Cesaroni_P38-4G_Classic_I285?zenid=vsrisevkgniqf6afnkdrnmu2k1)
** fine, and also probably encouraged
* Learn about and be comfortable using Reloadable rocket motors
** should be fine as long as it's model/high-powered
* Distributed laboratory software
** too vague
* Re-lightable motors, turn off and back on (means hybrid, or liquid engine, but not solid)
** certain fuels are controlled
** The MTCR Item 3 Cat II covers hybrid rocket motors, but the MTCR covers f**king everything associated with rockets anyway
* Ramp up test stand prototypes by increments of High-power certification levels
** each one would be considered individually
* Storage and handling of cryogenic liquids?
** I don't see that anywhere, but I could have missed it
** the CCL seems to list cryogenic parts if they are used to refine uranium, so there's that
* Simulation, analysis, design and testing of cooling systems (for combustion chamber, nozzle, and throat)
** not sure if it's controlled on its own, but since it's inseparable from the motors it's probably wrapped up there
* Variable nozzle designs
** who's idea was this? Oh, right, mine. Just ignore this one :)
* Flow visualization
* Nozzle comparison (Aerospike to traditional designs)
* Injector design (fuel and/or oxidizer) to maximize combustion efficiency
* Research Test stand configurations (vertical in addition to horizontal)
* Survey the existing instructions and informational materials for building engines and motors.
* Move from testing commercial off-the-shelf items (motors and engines) to building and testing custom built items.
* Address Instrumentation: how to collect data on motor tests.
* Material and manufacturing techniques for nozzles (3-D printed)
* Open source software altitude and flight profiles - Performance calculations
* Study fuel grain design (parameters) to optimize burn profile 
* Logistics, procedures, and infrastructure for Pay-for-testing, using Mach 30 equipment (income generation)
* 3-D printed fuel grains
* Research additional income streams RE: Propulsion (educational kits, grants, etc) - We can add this to all subsystems?
* Linear aerospike studies
* Combustion chemistry, develop open source software tools (NOTE: See NASA CEA)
* Environmental simulation and testing (expanding flight envelope)
* High operations tempo, flight rate motors.  
* Non-chemical propulsion (however this is low TRL/maturity)
* Developing refueling ground equipment “on the tarmac”
* Focus on maintainability, ease of operations.
* Procedures and equipment for “mode 2 operations” for simulation and testing
* Focus on safety procedures (not just during tests).
* Operational Countdown Checklist as it relates to the propulsion engine test checklist procedures.
* Develop a cultural delineation between “Operations or Test staff” and “Design staff” -- Maybe eventually specialize into 3 groups
* Handbook for stakeholder collaboration (state, local, federal agencies and regulations)
* Rules of thumb for Launch/test site size space, in handbook form.
* Develop relationships with potential test sites
* Acoustic, Vibration, Acceleration simulation and testing.  
* Procedures to optimize, advertize, public viewing and interaction SAFELY.
* Remote viewing (Cameras for online streaming video streaming) to maximize audience.
* Rocket exhaust plume studies (morse code??)
* Ground operations communications equip and procedures.
* Disaster recovery plan for catastrophic mishap.
* Procurement/development of transportation and handling equipment for stands and motors (flatbed trailers, etc)
