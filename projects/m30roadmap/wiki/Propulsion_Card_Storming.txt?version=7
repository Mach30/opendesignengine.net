h1. Propulsion Card Storming

Covers fuel & oxidizer storage, injector, combustion chamber, nozzle, and anything necessary to keep those items “stable”

h2. Unsorted list of ideas

* Indoor test stand for testing a compressed air "cold gas thruster":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster
** test stands don't seem to be mentioned anywhere specifically
** probably fine just cuz it's so low power anyway
* 3D printed cold gas thruster for use on an indoor test stand
** hard to picture how this is anything other than a pneumatic valve
** maybe pneumatic valves are controlled if they have a certain capacity
* staging hobby and high-powered rocket motors
** the federal stuff doesn't cover this size rockets
** I haven't seen the relevant regs yet
* develop a series of larger test stands scaled around the classes of model and high powered rocketry certifications
** see first test stand comment above
* recreate Greg's undergrad sugar hybrid motor
** probably fine since it's probably equivalent to a class project
* upgrade Mach 30 test stand DAQ to include high speed video
** I doubt anyone cares about high speed video
* develop Arduino (or similar) model rocket launch controller board (including physical safety lock)
** model rockets are okay
* upgrade Mach 30 test stand DAQ to work over ethernet to extend operational range between operators and test stand
** fine. actually probably encouraged for safety reasons
* series of courses/kits to take users through high powered rocketry certs ("required to purchase high powered motors":http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Motors/Cesaroni_Propellant_Kits/Cesaroni_Certification_Special/38mm_Certification_Propellants/Cesaroni_P38-4G_Classic_I285?zenid=vsrisevkgniqf6afnkdrnmu2k1)
** fine, and also probably encouraged
* Learn about and be comfortable using Reloadable rocket motors
** should be fine as long as it's model/high-powered
* Distributed laboratory software
** too vague
* Re-lightable motors, turn off and back on (means hybrid, or liquid engine, but not solid)
** certain fuels are controlled
** The MTCR Item 3 Cat II covers hybrid rocket motors, but the MTCR covers f**king everything associated with rockets anyway
* Ramp up test stand prototypes by increments of High-power certification levels
** each one would be considered individually
* Storage and handling of cryogenic liquids?
** I don't see that anywhere, but I could have missed it
** the CCL seems to list cryogenic parts if they are used to refine uranium, so there's that
* Simulation, analysis, design and testing of cooling systems (for combustion chamber, nozzle, and throat)
** not sure if it's controlled on its own, but since it's inseparable from the motors it's probably wrapped up there
* Variable nozzle designs
** who's idea was this? Oh, right, mine. Just ignore this one :)
* Flow visualization
** anything that already exists will have the export control question answered
** something new might run into the controls
** CCL 9B005 mentions things that simulate flows above certain mach and reynolds numbers, but they say "devices"
** CCL 9D004 calls out simulation of engine flow 
** CCL 9E003 captures stuff that simulates flows in commercial aircraft engines
* Nozzle comparison (Aerospike to traditional designs)
** anything already published is fine
** I'm curious whether or not an aerospike type of approach would count as an "active control" on a rocket. It seems like a rocket has to have an engine at a minimum, and more than one engine doesn't fundamentally change that, and neither does throttling the engine. Arranging the engines so that you can point the rocket by adjusting the throttle of one or more engines seems like it shouldn't be considered a special "active" control system. 
** even the MTCR in Item 2 Cat 2 only covers movable engine nozzles, or movable engines, or movable fins.
* Injector design (fuel and/or oxidizer) to maximize combustion efficiency
** I can't find anything on that specifically
** it's hard to imagine that high performance rocket fuel nozzles wouldn't be captured somewhere
* Research Test stand configurations (vertical in addition to horizontal)
** probably fine, especially if it's for hobby/high-powered rocket engines
* Survey the existing instructions and informational materials for building engines and motors.
** fine since the stuff already exists
* Move from testing commercial off-the-shelf items (motors and engines) to building and testing custom built items.
** too vague; each step would be evaluated independently
* Address Instrumentation: how to collect data on motor tests.
** that should be fine
* Material and manufacturing techniques for nozzles (3-D printed)
** MTCR Item 3 Cat II lists rocket nozzles
** The CCL specifically says that rocket nozzles belong to the department of state
* Open source software altitude and flight profiles - Performance calculations
** if it already exists it shouldn't be a problem
* Study fuel grain design (parameters) to optimize burn profile 
** not enough expertise to search properly, but it seems like rocket fuel research is probably captured somewhere
* Logistics, procedures, and infrastructure for Pay-for-testing, using Mach 30 equipment (income generation)
** totally fine. capitalism is encouraged
* 3-D printed fuel grains
** same as last fuel grains comment
* Research additional income streams RE: Propulsion (educational kits, grants, etc) - We can add this to all subsystems?
** totally fine
* Linear aerospike studies
** not sure what this is
* Combustion chemistry, develop open source software tools (NOTE: See NASA CEA)
** I can't do a good search on this
* Environmental simulation and testing (expanding flight envelope)
** I can't do a good search on this either
* High operations tempo, flight rate motors.  
** I haven't seen high ops tempo used as a discriminator on the USML or CCL
* Non-chemical propulsion (however this is low TRL/maturity)
* Developing refueling ground equipment “on the tarmac”
** I'm pretty sure ground support equipment is captured in MTCR Item 12 Cat II, but that could mean rocket launchers specifically, not just any generic ground support
* Focus on maintainability, ease of operations.
** fine
* Procedures and equipment for “mode 2 operations” for simulation and testing
** not sure what mode 2 means
* Focus on safety procedures (not just during tests).
** fine, probably encouraged
* Operational Countdown Checklist as it relates to the propulsion engine test checklist procedures.
** fine
* Develop a cultural delineation between “Operations or Test staff” and “Design staff” -- Maybe eventually specialize into 3 groups
** fine
* Handbook for stakeholder collaboration (state, local, federal agencies and regulations)
** fine, probably encouraged
* Rules of thumb for Launch/test site size space, in handbook form.
** fine, probably exists already, also probably encouraged
* Develop relationships with potential test sites
** fine
* Acoustic, Vibration, Acceleration simulation and testing. 
** I can't do a good search on this subject 
* Procedures to optimize, advertize, public viewing and interaction SAFELY.
** fine, probably encouraged
* Remote viewing (Cameras for online streaming video streaming) to maximize audience.
** fine
* Rocket exhaust plume studies (morse code??)
** fine
* Ground operations communications equip and procedures.
** fine
* Disaster recovery plan for catastrophic mishap.
** fine
* Procurement/development of transportation and handling equipment for stands and motors (flatbed trailers, etc)
** fine
