h1. Structures and Mechanisms Card Storming

h2. Unsorted list of ideas

* DIGITAL FABRICATION OF COMPONENTS AND MECHANISMS
** could be a problem if it's used to make something that is itself controlled
* AN OPEN PLATFORM OF STANDARDS (Like LEGOS)
** vague, but shouldn't be a problem
* PAYLOAD MOUNT FOR ARDUINOS
** I have a hard time seeing how this would be a problem; nobody's using an arduino on an actual launch vehicle
* UPGRADED ELECTRONICS PAYLOAD STRUCTURES - LIKE FOR FIN-FACING CAMERAS
** payload adapters for launch vehicles are controlled
** "...including the articles identified in section 1516 of Public Law 105–261: satellite fuel, ground support equipment, test equipment, payload adapter or interface hardware..."
* FABRICATION IN MAKERSPACES WITH LOCAL TOOLS
** fine as long as nothing needs to be controlled
** or we invent a new way to build an ad-hoc network of people who obey export controls
* EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES
** The rules do specify that model/HP rockets need to have a minimum of metal components
** any advanced materials or techniques will inevitably run into USML or CCL rules
* SOFTWARE TOOLS - CODECAD AND OPENSOURCECAD (CADQUERY)
** already open source tools will be fine
** we might run into trouble if we create new software for modeling actual launch vehicles
* COLLAPSIBLE AND EXPANDABLE MECHANISMS (“ORAGAMI ROCKET”)
* THE “BLACK BOX” FOR MODEL ROCKET (CHEAP, DURABLE, RECOVERABLE, LIKE www.carbonorigins.com)
* HARDWARE TOOLS AND JIGS
* SCALABLE PARTS, AND THE ASSOCIATED STANDARDS FOR USING THEM
* SOFTWARE - STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS TOOLS (LIKE FEA, NASTRAN, etc.)
* (linked to propulsion as well) PROPULSION TEST STAND STRUCTURE
* (stretching outside the box a bit) SCALE MODEL OF A SIMULATED LAUNCH COMPLEX.  FULL GROUND OPS SIMULATION
* (linked in to aerodynamics as well) FIN DESIGN BASED ON J’S MASTERS THESIS (OPTIMIZING SUPERSONIC STRUCTURES TO PREVENT FLUTTER)
* STRUCTURAL TESTING (DESTRUCTIVE OR OTHERWISE)
* STRUCTURAL DESIGN BEST PRACTICES FOR MANUFACTURING, AND OPERATIONS, (AKA LIFECYCLE CONSIDERATION)
* STRUCTURAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT
* MATERIALS TESTING FORM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE (UV, THERMAL, (eventually) VACUUM
* STRUCTURAL INCORPORATION OF A “MISSION OBJECTIVE” (like rube goldburg, or scientific experiment)
* (linked to electrical/power)  HOW TO INCORPORATE POWER STORAGE INTO STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS
* ADDRESSING REUSABILITY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS
* HIGH-RELIABILITY RECOVERY SYSTEM (MECHANISMS)
* (building on Legos idea) Modular model rocket kit (1 kit, several rockets; maybe based around "NARTREK":http://www.nar.org/model-rocket-info/nartek-skills-program/ missions)
* Structural Analysis software for both dynamic and static analysis
* Launch Pad design/structures
* Go extermely small size (Just how small can I get it?)
** sharing files, etc
** educational/entertainment
** very open source
* Evaluation/research of tools and machines required to build rockets at scale we are looking at -> Toolset analysis
* Make sure the materials research covers non-obvious choices (to us at least) like composites, etc
* Unconventional rockets, like rocket/jet-powered rotors
