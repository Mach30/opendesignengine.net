The cured EG may work perfectly for our purposes even with some bubbles but it is better safe than sorry."

Now we need to find some melamine and at time that we can get together with Tux-Lab to get the components routed out.

Need to design and attach a super-structure and internal support system.

I also need to get Tux-Lab measurements for the files."
