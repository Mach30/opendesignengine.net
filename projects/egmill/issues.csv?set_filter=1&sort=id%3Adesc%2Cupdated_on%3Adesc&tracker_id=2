Now we need to find some melamine and at time that we can get together with Tux-Lab to get the components routed out.

Need to design and attach a super-structure and internal support system.

I also need to get Tux-Lab measurements for the files."

The cured EG may work perfectly for our purposes even with some bubbles but it is better safe than sorry."
