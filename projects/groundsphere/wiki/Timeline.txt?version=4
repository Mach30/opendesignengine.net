h1. Ground Sphere Timeline v0.2

h3. Overview

The goal is to complete the project so we can ship version 0.2+ ground stations to SkyCube backers in time to receive "space tweets" while it is operating in orbit.  Note, this is an all volunteer project, so team members and observers should remember that the schedule will flex some while still being focused on hitting the project goal.

See the "Gantt chart":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/groundsphere/issues/gantt if you would like to track the progress of this project. The best way to see the entire timeline of the project is to set the *Status* pull down menu to *All*, and set the filters to be *6* months from *October 2013* (Figure 1). Then click "Apply".
