h1. Ground Sphere Budget v0.2

h3. Overview

The materials cost should be kept under $100 to limit the retail cost of the kit. There are currently three prototypes planned. The project budget should cover all three prototypes plus overage. To that end, the threshold project budget (max) is $500 and the objective is $400.
