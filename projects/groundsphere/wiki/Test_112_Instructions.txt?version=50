h2. Test 2: Field Test

Long range field test using low power transmitter at 915 MHz to verify the predicted link budget (which comes from <insert link to spreadsheet> analysis) and confirm signal reception.  It is recommended to conduct this test with at least 2 individuals.  These instructions assume that the receiver is already assembled and most recent software is installed.  If not, accomplish the next 2 steps.
# Follow the instruction for "GroundSphere Kit assembly"
# Follow the instructions for Operations Manual - "Getting Started and Set up"


*Test Date:*
20JUN2014@2115-2145MST  Test Location: MSL / Issyroo RF test range at 37°43'04.8"N 104°47'16.9"W, 10 miles North of Walsenburg, CO

*Record Test Conditions:*
26C ambient, outdoor test with full horizon to horizon window, ground station mounted to truck roof, fairly clean RF environment, though some RF energy may come from activities at a small airport located at 37°41'49.2"N 104°47'34.8"W.  No planes were observed to be in operation. Cell phones were turned off and batteries removed.  

*NOTE:* This series of tests were run at 0 degrees elevation, which means that the performance is higher in the cone shaped reception pattern beginning at 30 degrees elevation.  Computer simulation places the tested area at -5dB compared to the peak lobe with a small amount of interference from the close proximity to the ground (ground effect).  This means that actual performance will be higher for any satellite within reception range.  The reason for performing these tests in this manner was that in the low light conditions, it was against the use agreement for the facility to climb the tower.

*Additional Tools Needed:*
Laptop computer meeting or exceeding the minimum system requirements.
Portable table or truck bed (on which to set up receiver equip and computer)
Access to 120V a/c power for preamp (generator or car inverter) or DC adapter (vehicle power jack to 2.1mm preamp power jack).
Tape measure or distance finding equipment (GPS?)

*Safety concerns:*
Weather caution
Traffic caution
Portable power for equipment(?)

*Outcome*
* Partial verification of technical requirement 1.1.2, 
* Confirmation of Ground Sphere performance in optimal fielded conditions
* Confirmation of Ground Sphere performance at a far distance to simulate orbital conditions

h2. Test 3: From Orbit Test

Acquire signal from orbiting cubesat operating on 915 MHz (NPS just launched two cubesats which use the same radio and configuration as SkyCube).  Orbital prediction software will need to be used to calculate the appropriate timing for this test.  It is only possible to conduct the steps below in anticipation of a 915 MHz signal source flying overhead.  These instructions assume that the receiver is already assembled and most recent software is installed.  If not, accomplish the next 2 steps.
