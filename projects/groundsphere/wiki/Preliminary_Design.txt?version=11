h1. Ground Sphere Preliminary Design v0.1 (OUTDATED)

{{toc}}

h3. Introduction

This document covers the preliminary design decisions for the *Ground Sphere* ground station.  The document includes three sections: technical background on *SkyCube's* radio, hardware design of *Ground Sphere*, and software design of *Ground Sphere*.  The design is structured in parallel with the [[Requirements Document]] to ensure all requirements are satisfied.

h3. SkyCube Radio Details

*SkyCube* uses a Colony 2 (CII) radio from "AstroDev":http://www.astrodev.com/public_html2/.  The specific radio is the Boeing variation as documented in the following PDF ("CII_Specification_08042010.pdf":http://www.astrodev.com/public_html2/downloads/datasheet/CIIUserManual.pdf).

The *SkyCube* radio operates at 915 MHz with a transmit power of 2 W.  It has an omni-directional antenna which adds negligible gain.
