h3. Procedure

# Remove all parts from the box and protective coverings.
# Using a common screwdriver, unscrew the outlet cover mounting screws and remove the outlet cover (ANT04).
# Insert the antenna line (ANT13) SMA connector through the hole in the outlet cover (ANT04).
# Thread the outlet cover (ANT04) on to the upper assembly threads, twisting until moderately tight.
# Connect the antenna line (ANT13) SMA connector to the input connector of the preamp (RAD02).  
## Finger tight should be fine, but if the clearance is too tight to get access, use an 8mm combination wrench to turn the connector.  
## Do not tighten beyond lightly snug, or the SMA connector may snap off the preamp (RAD02).
# Using a common screwdriver, reattach the outlet cover (ANT04) to the base.
# Place the ground plane assembly over the purple coupling section.
# Insert the purple coupling section into the upper assembly and press until snug.
# Loosen all four aerial retention screws on the aerial terminals (ANT07).
# Using a toothpick to push it through from the bottom, thread the conductive thread tail into the marked aerial terminal.
# Insert the aerial ends into opposing aerial terminals, taking care not to drop the ground lead from the ground plane.
# Tighten the aerial retention screws on the aerial terminals (ANT07).
# View the assembled unit from the top and adjust the loops to be vertical and perpendicular to each other.
