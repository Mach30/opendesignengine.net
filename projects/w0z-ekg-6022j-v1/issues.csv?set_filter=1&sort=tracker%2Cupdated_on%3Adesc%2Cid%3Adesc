169,New,Laboratory EKG Pre-Amplifier,Bug,Normal,Enclosure Marking/Machining Accuracy Issue,Amanda Wozniak,"","",Amanda Wozniak,09/03/2013,"",0,"","",09/03/2013 12:08 pm,09/03/2013 12:08 pm,"I exported a DXF of the mechanical layers of the top assembly, and used that to laser-mark the enclosure lids for pilot drills. _*But aligning the drill press by hand when you care about alignment tolerances is a poor choice.*_

In the first five units, I wasn't able to machine the enclosure lids or bodies to any reasonable tolerance, so my fits were poor. I had to compensate by using stepped drill bits to add a lot of slop to all the holes. 

I need to fabricate a registration guide/jig that I can clamp to my work-piece which allows me to more precisely align my drills. 

_*PROPOSED SOLUTION:*_ 

# dimension/draw enclosure lid perimter with mounting holes
# Use DXF to laser-cut a jig for the pilot holes - include perimeter with mounting holes for registration
# figure out a way to clamp/fixture the workpiece on my drill press
# test-drill using jig
# if that works - repeat process for enclosure body"
