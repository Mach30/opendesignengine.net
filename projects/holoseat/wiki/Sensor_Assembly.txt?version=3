h1. Sensor Assembly

{{>toc}}

h2. Tools

* Holoseat Test Stand with computer to operate it
* Soldering iron with stand
* Helping hands
* Exhaust fan
* Sensor assembly jig (3D printed tool - provide link)
* Flush snips
* Safety glasses

h2. Materials

* Instant/super glue (prefer Loctite Super Glue Ultragel Control)
* Solder
* (1) WSSM-01: TRRS Audio Connector PCB
* (1) WSSM-02: TLE4966L Infineon Technologies High Precsn Hall / Board Mount Hall Effect/Magnetic Sensor
* (1) WSSM-03: Sensor Housing Lower Half
* (1) WSSM-04: Sensor Housing Upper Half
* (1) WSSM-05: 3M 9472LE Tape 1/2" x 1" piece

h2. Safety Issues

* Care must be taken when using the soldering iron, the tip is very hot
* Always wear safety glasses while working with soldering irons
* Avoid breathing in the soldering fumes, use a vent or hood if needed to provide adequate ventilation

h2. Product

HS-04: Wheel Speed Sensor Module

h2. Procedure

h3. 1. Place sensor on TRRS Audio Connector PCB

# Place *WSSM-02: TLE4966L Sensor* in jig with label facing “out” (toward window in jig)
# Slide *TLE4966L Sensor* into jig until its label aligns can be seen through the window in jig
# Bend *TLE4966L Sensor* leads down along jig
# Place *TLE4966L Sensor* pins through holes in *WSSM-01: TRRS Audio Connector PCB* with the jack facing up
# Align *TRRS Audio Connector PCB* with lip on jig
# Bend *TLE4966L Sensor* leads over to fix position of sensor relative *TRRS Audio Connector PCB*
# Remove *TLE4966L Sensor/TRRS Audio Connector PCB* sub-assembly from jig

h3. 2. Solder sensor to board

h3. 3. Verify sensor

h3. 4. Finish assembly
