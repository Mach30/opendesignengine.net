This page covers research into creating a Bluetooth HID connection from the Holoseat controller to the gaming system (PC or console).  The Holoseat controller will need to be able to present itself as either a keyboard & mouse combination or a joypad.  Much of the following research was found by following the links from a Hackaday post - "Convert Any USB Keyboard to Bluetooth":http://hackaday.com/2016/09/04/convert-any-usb-keyboard-to-bluetooth/.
