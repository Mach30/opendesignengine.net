h2. Tools

* Holoseat Test Stand with computer to operate it
* Soldering iron with stand
* Helping hands
* Exhaust fan
* Sensor assembly jig (3D printed tool - provide link)
* Flush snips
* Safety glasses

h2. Materials

* Instant/super glue (prefer Loctite Super Glue Ultragel Control)
* Solder
* Isopropyl alcohol
* Cotton balls
* (1) WSSM-01: TRRS Audio Connector PCB
* (1) WSSM-02: TLE4966L Infineon Technologies High Precsn Hall / Board Mount Hall Effect/Magnetic Sensor
* (1) WSSM-03: Sensor Housing Lower Half
* (1) WSSM-04: Sensor Housing Upper Half
* (1) WSSM-05: 3M 9472LE Tape 5/8" x 1" piece

h2. Safety Issues

* Care must be taken when using the soldering iron, the tip is very hot
* Always wear safety glasses while working with soldering irons
* Avoid breathing in the soldering fumes, use a vent or hood if needed to provide adequate ventilation

h2. Procedure

h3. 1. Place sensor on TRRS Audio Connector PCB

# Place *WSSM-02: TLE4966L Sensor* in jig with label facing “out” (toward window in jig)
# Slide *TLE4966L Sensor* into jig until its label aligns can be seen through the window in jig
# Bend *TLE4966L Sensor* leads down along jig
# Place *TLE4966L Sensor* pins through holes in *WSSM-01: TRRS Audio Connector PCB* with the jack facing up
# Align *TRRS Audio Connector PCB* with lip on jig
# Bend *TLE4966L Sensor* leads over to fix position of sensor relative *TRRS Audio Connector PCB*
# Remove *TLE4966L Sensor/TRRS Audio Connector PCB* sub-assembly from jig

h3. 2. Solder TLE4966L Sensor to TRRS Audio Connector PCB

# Place *TLE4966L Sensor/TRRS Audio Connector PCB* sub-assembly in helping hands 
*Insert Pic*
# Solder all 4 *TLE4966L Sensor* leads to their pins on the *TRRS Audio Connector PCB*
# Trim back excess leads from *TLE4966L Sensor* 
*Insert Pic*

h3. 3. Verify sensor

# Place *TLE4966L Sensor/TRRS Audio Connector PCB* sub-assembly in *WSSM-03: Sensor Housing Lower Half*
*Insert Pic*
# Connect sensor cable from test stand to *Wheel Speed Sensor* sub-assembly
# Place *Wheel Speed Sensor* sub-assembly in sensor mount on test stand
*Insert Pic*
# Run tests - see test stand for API calls/application used for these tests
## Verify direction
### it should report cw when wheel turns 20 rpm cw
### it should report ccw when wheel turns 20 rpm ccw
## Verify cadence
### it should report 30 +/- 10% when wheel turns cw at 30 rpm
### it should report 45 +/- 15% when wheel turns cw at 45 rpm

h3. 4. Finish assembly

# Take *Wheel Speed Sensor* sub-assembly off test stand
# Place *WSSM-04: Sensor Housing Upper Half* on top of *WSSM-03: Sensor Housing Lower Half*
*Insert Pic*
# Press *Sensor Housing Upper Half* into *Sensor Housing Lower Half* until it clicks into place and sits flush on the *Sensor Housing Lower Half*
*Inser Pic*
# Add *9472LE Tape*
## Clean the bottom of the *Wheel Speed Sensor Module* with isopropyl alcohol using a cotton ball
## Wait for the alcohol to dry
## Cut 5/8" long piece of *9472LE Tape*
## Apply *9472LE Tape* to the bottom of the *Wheel Speed Sensor Module*
*Insert Pic*
## Press *Wheel Speed Sensor Module* firmly onto a flat surface for 60 seconds
## Trim excess tape off of *Wheel Speed Sensor Module*
*Insert Pic*
