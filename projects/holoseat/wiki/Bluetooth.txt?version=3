h2. Background

This page covers research into creating a Bluetooth HID connection from the Holoseat controller to the gaming system (PC or console).  The Holoseat controller will need to be able to present itself as either a keyboard & mouse combination or a joypad.  Much of the following research was found by following the links from a Hackaday post - "Convert Any USB Keyboard to Bluetooth":http://hackaday.com/2016/09/04/convert-any-usb-keyboard-to-bluetooth/.

h2. Maker/Hacker Example

In this example, the firmware from the "RN-42":https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12574 onto the "HC-05":http://cdn.makezine.com/uploads/2014/03/hc_hc-05-user-instructions-bluetooth.pdf.  This kind of hacking, while interesting, is not strictly legal (obtaining the RN-42 firmware is not something one just does), so it is not a recommended approach.  However, it does demonstrate how capable a small system can be at capturing signals from one system (the joypad) and in real time translating them to HID over Bluetooth signals.  Consider this evidence that the kind of inline gameplay translation we want the Holoseat controller to do is possible.

h2. ESP32 Wifi Bluetooth Module

"ESP32 Wifi Bluetooth Module":http://www.cnx-software.com/2016/09/05/you-can-now-buy-esp3212-esp32-wifi-bluetooth-module-for-6-95, another Bluetooth module that has people talking.  Need to do more research.
