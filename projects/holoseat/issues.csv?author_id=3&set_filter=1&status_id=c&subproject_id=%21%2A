276,Resolved,Holoseat,Bug,Normal,Sensors are 5v logic feeding into 3.3v inputs on the controller,Bryan Christian,"","",J. Simmons,02/06/2017,"",0,"","",02/06/2017 06:45 pm,04/22/2017 09:25 am,We have somehow managed to get away feeding the 5v logic from the Hall Effect sensors into our 3.3v logic controllers (both the v0.3 controller and the in development v0.4 controller).  We need to step the 5v logic down to 3.3v logic for the final design in v0.4.
272,Resolved,Holoseat,Bug,Normal,Walking forward is sometimes interrupted by one or two backward steps,J. Simmons,"","",J. Simmons,11/21/2016,"",0,"","",11/21/2016 07:18 pm,01/19/2017 05:29 am,"This can happen from a stand still or in the middle of walking forward.  It appears to be related to your actual cadence, your trigger cadence, and the timing between the two hall effect sensors.  More research will need to be done to determine the underlying cause."
