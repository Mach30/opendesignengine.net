	</ul>
	</li>
		<li><strong>GS2R 1.4</strong> The external components of the ground station must be able to handle rain, dust, winds up to 80km/h, as well as cold (-20C) and hot (60C) temperatures.</li>
		<li><strong>GS2R 1.5</strong> The external components of the ground station must be able to be mounted securely to a structure or vehicle.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>GS2R 2.1</strong> The ground station must be designed so that the components may be quickly and easily set up and torn down by minimally qualified personnel and with common tools.</li>
		<li><strong>GS2R 2.3</strong> All components must either be commercially available or available in “kitified” form.</li>

		<li><strong>GS2R 2.5</strong> A safety guide must be included with the kit, the above instruction manual, and be made publicly available on the internet.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>GS2R 3.1</strong> The user constructing the ground station will be expected to provide their own equipment as follows:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>GS2R 3.1.1</strong> A laptop or other portable computer.</li>
		<li><strong>GS2R 3.1.2</strong> A dual band (UHF/VHF) amateur band handheld transceiver (HT) with at least 5W output transmit power.</li>
		<li><strong>GS2R 3.1.3</strong> Additional modules or equipment necessary for meeting additional user requirements.</li>
