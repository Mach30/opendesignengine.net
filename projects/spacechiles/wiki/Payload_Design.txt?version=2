h1. Payload Design

FAA regulations limit the mass of any non-separable balloon component to 2.72kg (6lb). This means that we should limit our functional payload mass to 2kg, possibly up to 2.2kg. Any components requiring a thermally stable environment (e.g. batteries, some electronics) should live within a polystyrene insulating box (beer cooler). Dissipated power should warm the inside of the box to reasonable working temperatures.


h2. Chile Seed Packets

Balloon launches will carry a packet of New Mexico green chile seeds.


h2. GPS 

Any GPS module must be rated to altitudes beyond 60,000 feet. Certain older models cease function above this altitude due to now-deprecated government regulations. 


h2. Radio Tracking/Telemetry

Tracking and telemetry should be broadcast using a 144.39MHz APRS amateur radio transmitter. The APRS protocol is designed to provide generalized two-way packetized communications, including location and arbitrary telemetry. APRS packets are routed to the internet and location is broadly supported, meaning that ground teams would be able to track the balloon using only a smartphone. More info at http://www.aprs.org/
Whoever is responsible for the transmitter will need to have an amateur radio license of Technician class or better. 


h2. Environmental Data

Eternal and internal temperature --- possible temperature range from 30C to -70C
Pressure -- 100kPa (sea level) to 500Pa (30km). 


h2. Camera

GoPro camera?


h2. Data Logging/Computer

Arduino?


h2. Power Supply

Li-Ion, LiPo, or Lithium Primary batteries. Some components (e.g camera) may have their own power supplies.
