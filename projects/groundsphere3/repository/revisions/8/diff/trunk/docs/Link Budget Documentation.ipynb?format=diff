If you're attempting to calculate an estimate, knowing what the gain of the antenna, radio, and amplifier are is helpful, where you may then be able to use a conservative estimate for the loss of other components in the system. This estimate may be 1.0db to 1.5db of loss in the 100MHz range (or higher for longer lengths of transmission line).
