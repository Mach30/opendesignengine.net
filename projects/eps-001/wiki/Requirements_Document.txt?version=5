ADC - Analog to digital converter.
Buffered - Indirect connection which allows input which would potentially be destructive to the unit to be handled safely.
Burn-in - A practice to test all production units under load for a proscribed time, causing and failures to occur during testing instead of after deployment.
Clipped - In this instance, preventing input which would be damaging to components from exceeding a certain level. 
ECLSS - Environmental Control and Life Support Subsystem, a component block of a spacecraft or HAB payload.
EPS - Electrical Power Subsystem, a component block of a spacecraft or HAB payload.
GPIO - General Purpose Input and Output, a way of connecting a sensor to a computer or microcontroller.
HAB - High Altitude Balloon
Hall effect - The production of voltage transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current.
Hall effect sensor - A sensor which uses the hall effect to detect a magnetic field or electric current.
Isolation - In this instance, the ability of a sensor to prevent high voltage from a sensed circuit from crossing over to the sensor's data connection.
MAC controller - A chip which contains all the electrical and logic circuits to connect to Ethernet connections.
