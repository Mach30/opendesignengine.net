99,Closed,AttenuatorX,Milestone,Normal,Complete schematic for XTest1,Jack Linke,"","",Jack Linke,12/22/2012,12/23/2012,100,4.0,"",12/21/2012 09:54 pm,12/24/2012 01:12 am,"Design the schematic for XTest1. The following parts will be required, at a minimum:
- BNC Jacks (PC Edge Mount)
- Chip attenuator
- Digital attenuator chip
- AVR ATTiny microcontroller
- Associated resistors, caps, etc

100,Closed,AttenuatorX,Milestone,Normal,Design PCB for XTest1,Jack Linke,"","",Jack Linke,12/26/2012,12/30/2012,100,18.0,"",12/21/2012 09:56 pm,12/30/2012 10:32 pm,"Design the PCB for XTest1, ensuring correct layout procedures are followed for RF designs up to 3GHz."
101,Closed,AttenuatorX,Milestone,Normal,Order XTest1 PCB,Jack Linke,"","",Jack Linke,12/30/2012,12/31/2012,100,1.0,"",12/21/2012 09:57 pm,12/31/2012 07:12 pm,"Place the board on order, so firmware development and device testing can be planned."
115,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,"The header should be SMT (as I already determined in the BOM), not through-hole (as I designed the board), and it should be on the bottom of the board.","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:25 pm,02/11/2013 08:25 pm,For now I’m just making do with through-hole headers.
117,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,"The pad I designed for the on-off switch isn’t wide enough. With enough solder, it works, but it’s not right.","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:26 pm,02/11/2013 08:26 pm,Correct this in a future version
118,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,High,"The LEDs displaying attenuation level are in opposite order. MSB should be on the left, like the silkscreen, but it’s on the right.","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:27 pm,02/11/2013 08:27 pm,Reverse the LED order.
119,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,High,No strain relief was provided for the battery connection.,"","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:27 pm,02/11/2013 08:27 pm,Identify and implement a good way of providing relief.
120,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,Something in my design seems to cause failures on pin PC1 when the Brown-out detection is enabled on the AVR microcontroller.,"","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:29 pm,02/11/2013 08:29 pm,Identify whether this is specific to my design or to the ATMega48PA. I experienced this with two different ATMega48PA microcontrollers on two separate XTest1 boards.
121,Closed,AttenuatorX,Bug,High,"R20, R21, and R22, which are the SPI series resistors, should be 33 ohms vice 1kohm","","","",Jack Linke,02/12/2013,"",0,"","",02/12/2013 09:14 pm,05/11/2013 08:20 pm,Change the values for these resistors in the schematics and add qty: (3) 33 ohm resistors to the BOM
116,Closed,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,At some point in the past I accidentally swapped the Slave Select (SS or LE) with the Serial Data (MOSI or SERIN).,"","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:26 pm,05/11/2013 08:20 pm,"I'll have to make a quick fix on the prototype PCB to correct this. I’ll pillar the associated serial resistors upright, and use fine wire to jumper across to the correct pads.

This issue has already been corrected on the schematic, but needs correction on the PCB."
114,Closed,AttenuatorX,Bug,Low,"The 0.1uF capacitors were 0508, but the pads I placed are 0805","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:25 pm,05/11/2013 08:21 pm,"For now I’m using some 0805 caps I had on hand, but If I re-build and re-order this board, I’ll need to change the pads. The circuit is designed to use 0508, since they slightly shorten the path to ground for decoupling."
