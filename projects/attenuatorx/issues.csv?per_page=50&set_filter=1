120,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,Something in my design seems to cause failures on pin PC1 when the Brown-out detection is enabled on the AVR microcontroller.,"","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:29 pm,02/11/2013 08:29 pm,Identify whether this is specific to my design or to the ATMega48PA. I experienced this with two different ATMega48PA microcontrollers on two separate XTest1 boards.
119,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,High,No strain relief was provided for the battery connection.,"","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:27 pm,02/11/2013 08:27 pm,Identify and implement a good way of providing relief.
118,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,High,"The LEDs displaying attenuation level are in opposite order. MSB should be on the left, like the silkscreen, but it’s on the right.","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:27 pm,02/11/2013 08:27 pm,Reverse the LED order.
117,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,"The pad I designed for the on-off switch isn’t wide enough. With enough solder, it works, but it’s not right.","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:26 pm,02/11/2013 08:26 pm,Correct this in a future version
115,New,AttenuatorX,Bug,Normal,"The header should be SMT (as I already determined in the BOM), not through-hole (as I designed the board), and it should be on the bottom of the board.","","","",Jack Linke,02/11/2013,"",0,"","",02/11/2013 08:25 pm,02/11/2013 08:25 pm,For now I’m just making do with through-hole headers.
