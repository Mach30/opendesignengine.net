h3. Procedure - Test Stand Body

# Produce Side and Top Boards
## Use a miter saw to cut (2) 12" long boards from *TSB-04: 36" Long 2x3 Board* to produce (2) *TSB-01: Side Boards*
(also requires tape measure, carpentry square, and pencil)
## Use a miter saw to cut (2) 5" long boards from *TSB-04: 36" Long 2x3 Board* to produce (2) *TSB-02: Top Boards*
(also requires tape measure, carpentry square, and pencil)
# Assemble the *TS-01: Holoseat Test Stand Body*
## Use the bar clamps to secure (1) *TSB-01: Side Boards* and (1) *TSB-02: Top Boards* in a butt joint flush with the edge of the side board and with their ends aligned
## Drill (2) 1/8" pilot holes through the face of the side board and into the edge of the top board
## Use (2) *TSB-03: @#9@ x 2-1/2" Coarse Thread Drywall Screws* to secure the side board to the top board
## Repeat the past 3 steps to attach the other *TSB-02: Top Boards* to the side board making sure the gap between the top boards is wide enough for the *TS-06: Nema 17 Stepper Motor Mount*
*INSERT PIC HERE*
## Place the *TS-06: Nema 17 Stepper Motor Mount* against the face of the side board between the top boards
## Drill (4) 1/16" pilot holes into the face of the side board
## Use (4) *TS-07: 1-1/4" Fine Thread Drywall Screws* to attach the motor mount to the side board making sure its top is flush with the top face of the top boards
*INSERT PIC HERE*
## Use the bar clamps to secure the other *TSB-01: Side Boards* to the opposite side of the (2) *TSB-02: Top Boards*
## Drill (2) 1/8" pilot holes through the face of the side board and into the edges of the top boards (1 hole in each top board)
## Use (2) *TSB-03: @#9@ x 2-1/2" Coarse Thread Drywall Screws* to secure the side board to the top boards
*INSERT PIC HERE*
# Paint the Test Stand Body
## Lightly sand the new test stand body
## Wipe down the test stand body with a rag
## Use Painter's Tape to mask the *TS-06: Nema 17 Stepper Motor Mount* so it does not get paint on it during the next step
## Apply (2) coats of *TSB-05: Semi-gloss latex paint* to the faces of the test stand body per the paint's instructions
