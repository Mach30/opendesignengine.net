should already be done
XYZ steps/mm set to calculated values "calculator":http://prusaprinters.org/calculator/
if that doesn't work "config axes":http://reprap.org/wiki/Builders/Config/Config_Axes
and http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter's_Calibration_Guide#Prerequisites

things to keep in mind
plastic shrinks as it cools down. this should be compensated for by the model, not by the printer
belts and fasteners loosen over time. make sure they're tight and check again if backlash appears later
stepper motors can miss steps if they are commanded to move faster than the power supplied to them allows. when you start printing at faster speeds watch out for missed steps
the shape of the infill can show through on thin perimeters. just increase the number of perimeters to hide it
changing temperatures affects results. watch out for breezes in the area your printer sits

before printing

motor current (correct stepper motor current)
axes (all axes parallel/perpendicular)
bed surface (ensure proper plastic adhesion)
bed level (extruder the same height at all points on bed)
Z home http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter's_Calibration_Guide#Z_height
gross extruder temperature
gross E steps/mm "commissioning":http://reprap.org/wiki/Commissioning http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter's_Calibration_Guide#E_steps

now you can print

? 3 known values of height/width ?
layer height (adjust by .01 till beautiful)
extrusion width 
precise extruder temperature http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter's_Calibration_Guide#Nozzle_Temperature
precise bed temperature http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter's_Calibration_Guide#Bed_Temperature
precise E steps/mm http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter's_Calibration_Guide#E_Steps_Fine_Tuning
infill (1.0 solid cube)
perimeter width (nesting blocks)
ooze control
bridging
overhang
