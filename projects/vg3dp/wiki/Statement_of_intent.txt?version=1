This is supposed to be a general guide. 
* focus on the math, science and engineering that is common in all cases
* avoid diving into the specific ways each individual tool handles things
* make as few assumptions as possible and clearly document them

Focusing on the general topic will increase value in the following ways:
* open source developers tend to start from scratch in at least one area; this will help them solve their unique problems
* open source users are often left to puzzle through incomplete documentation; this will help them fill in the holes
* everyone who uses 3D printing will benefit from a common core; this will help them leverage 3D printing's strengths while avoiding its weaknesses

Explain things visually
* a proper illustration needs little (or no) explanation
* pictures avoid using different words for the same thing
* diagrams usually don't require any translation
* it's easier to compare what you see on the screen to what you hold in your hand
* pictures can be shared and "groked":http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grok more easily
